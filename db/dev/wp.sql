For example, the Image block placeholder displays custom borders and duotone filters even before selecting an image.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Compose richer lists and quotes with inner blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The List and Quote blocks now support inner blocks, allowing for more flexible and rich compositions like adding headings inside your Quote blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More responsive text with fluid typography</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers working with block themes and/or <code>theme.json</code>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/04/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-8-3-august/#fluid-typography-support\">fluid typography</a> lets you define font sizes that adapt for easy reading in any screen size.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Add starter patterns to any post type</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress 6.0, site builders could add suggested patterns so that when creating a new page, you did not have to start blank. In 6.1, site builders can continue to opt-in to this feature for not only pages but for any post type. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Find block themes faster</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes Directory has a filter for block themes, and a pattern preview gives a better sense of what the theme might look like while exploring different themes and patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Keep your Site Editor settings for later</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Editor settings are now <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/changes-to-block-editor-preferences-in-wordpress-6-1/\">persistent for each user</a>. This means your settings will now be consistent across browsers and devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A streamlined style system</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The CSS rules for margin, padding, typography, colors, and borders within the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/block-styles-generation-style-engine/\">styles engine</a> are now all in one place, reducing time spent on layout-specific tasks and helps to generate semantic class names.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Updated interface options and features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Updates include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/styling-elements-in-block-themes/\">styling elements</a> like buttons, citations, and links globally; controlling hover, active, and focus states for links using theme.json (not available to control in the interface yet); and customizing outline support for blocks and elements, among other features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Continued evolution of layout options</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The default content dimensions provided by themes can now be overridden in the Styles Sidebar, giving site builders better control over full-width content. Developers have <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/updated-editor-layout-support-in-6-1-after-refactor/\">fine-grained control over these controls</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Template parts in classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/04/block-based-template-parts-in-traditional-themes/\">Block template parts can now be defined in classic themes</a> by adding the appropriate HTML files `parts` directory at the root of the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Expanded support for Query Loop blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/extending-the-query-loop-block/\">New filters</a> let Query Block variations support custom queries for more powerful variations and advanced hierarchical post types filtering options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Filters for all your styles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/filters-for-theme-json-data/\">Leverage filters</a> in the Styles sidebar to control settings at all four levels of your site—core, theme, user, or block, from less to more specific.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spacing presets for faster, consistent design</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Save time and avoid hard-coding values into a theme with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/07/introduction-of-presets-across-padding-margin-and-block-gap/\">preset margin and padding values for multiple blocks.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Content-only editing support for container blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to content-only editing settings, layouts can be locked within container blocks. In a content-only block, its children are invisible to the List View and entirely uneditable. So you control the layout while your writers can focus on the content. Combine it with block-locking options for even more advanced control over your blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Other notes of interest</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>6.1 includes a new time-to-read feature showing content authors the approximate time-to-read values for pages, posts, and custom post types.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The site tagline is empty by default in new sites but can be modified in General Settings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new modal design offers a background blur effect, making it easier to focus on the task at hand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Enhancing WordPress 6.1 Accessibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility is an integral part of the WordPress mission of fostering an inclusive community and supporting users of all types around the world.

more than a way to succeed online. It&#8217;s a community that has always answered his questions and helped him learn, and has enabled his voice to be heard across the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are motivating benefits for Raghavendra, who has a vision impairment that introduces challenges to many of the things he wants to do. The WordPress community has helped him make some of his dreams come true. After chatting with others at WordPress events, about his wish to go trekking and running, he found he was later contacted by people in the community went with him to do just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"534\" height=\"748\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-3.jpg?resize=534%2C748&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Raghavendra training for a marathon in 2013.\" class=\"wp-image-13702\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-3.jpg?w=534&amp;ssl=1 534w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-3.jpg?resize=214%2C300&amp;ssl=1 214w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 534px) 100vw, 534px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Raghavendra training for a marathon in 2013</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He also found WordPress events a way to raise the importance of accessibility issues, share tips, and connect local communities so they can collaborate on items both within and outside WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Life growing up with an enabling family</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A key asset for Raghavendra has been the support of his family as he coped with his progressive blindness. His sister took charge of teaching him important social and life skills, so he could navigate his country&#8217;s rigorous education system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those were the early days of technology everywhere, and nobody much was thinking about using it in education and day-to-day life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Raghavendra got his first computer, in 2004, it was a revelation. His sister taught him to use the internet efficiently, and he taught himself a few basics of programming. Soon he was spending 10 to 12 hours a day exploring the online world and learning about the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Discovering WordPress and blogging</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2006, he learned basic web design and began to sell website templates. His growing interest in search engines and content led him to WordPress. As the years progressed, his eyesight deteriorated. He had to relearn his skills and acquire new ones to compensate. When he could no longer see the computer screen, he learnt to use screen readers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point there was a gap: he had the same business skills, but he couldn&#8217;t apply them as effectively until he got comfortable with using screen readers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/4.jpg?resize=800%2C534&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Raghavendra speaking at an event in Bangalore, India in 2014.

On his 23rd birthday, he had two firsts: registering a domain and publishing a blog post. At first he wrote about things happening in his daily life, which initially got low responses. But when he started attending blogging and tech meetups, he received encouragement from fellow bloggers who complimented him on his writing style. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using WordPress to publish his story, Raghavendra found a love for writing and this made him want to learn and understand WordPress much better.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<h2>“Writing freed my mind and soul from the pain and sorrow; it takes a person into a Zen state where one can understand their soul once they see their own thoughts on paper.”</h2>\n<cite>Raghavendra Satish Peri</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There were still some ongoing challenges arising from his difficulties with seeing. For example, Raghavendra found coding was made more complicated. But he took it slowly, and he improved steadily.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started as many WordPressers do, installing themes and plugins, and making minor changes to the code. Ultimately, he moved all of his sites to WordPress, and as he learned more about WordPress, he could help his friends and family more with their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After just a few years, Raghavendra had the skills and the confidence to build just about anything in WordPress, progressing from simple to complex websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today Raghavendra is a successful entrepreneur. He sees his life as full of promise. WordPress still helps him grow every day, professionally and personally.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“There is always hope for tomorrow! Do not look for the light at the end of the tunnel, embrace the darkness, listen to the quietness, and feel the airflow. You will know that light is ahead even before you see it.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n<cite>Raghavendra Satish Peri</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contribute to accessibility and WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing Raghavendra has in common with many WordPressers is his enthusiasm and involvement in the community. As he has learnt more about the software, he felt he needed to be involved with improving accessibility too. He started to help organize local meetups and conferences and encourages others to give time and skills to contribute too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"704\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-5.jpg?resize=704%2C500&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"2016, Raghavendra on stage speaking at WordCamp Mumbai\" class=\"wp-image-13699\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-5.jpg?w=704&amp;ssl=1 704w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-5.jpg?resize=300%2C213&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 704px) 100vw, 704px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">2016, Raghavendra speaking at WordCamp Mumbai</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>He follows software development closely, especially where WordPress meets accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, on learning about a global WordPress Accessibility event, he applied and became a speaker. His topic was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bvgLjWCRfrQ\">Gutenberg Accessibility, A Screen Reader User&#8217;s Perspective</a>. His interest continued as a result of this event, and he wanted to be part of growing its audience and impact, initially through joining its dedicated channel on Slack. Eventually, he joined the organizing team for future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping run WordPress events brought together all of Raghavendra&#8217;s existing skills. It taught him a lot about what it takes to make an event truly inclusive, from captions and sign language to media players and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As his involvement has grown, Raghavendra has found it has become easier to source and use resources that make events and presentations more accessible. But knows there&#8217;s always more that can be learnt in this area, and encourages others to use understanding from events like the Accessibility Days in their conferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join the global WordPress Accessibility Day 2022 online on November 2-3, 2022.&nbsp;It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/\">free to register</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"568\" height=\"173\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/wp-accessibility-day-22.png?resize=568%2C173&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress Accessibility Day 2022 logo in purple and turquoise\" class=\"wp-image-13783\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/wp-accessibility-day-22.png?w=568&amp;ssl=1 568w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/wp-accessibility-day-22.png?resize=300%2C91&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 568px) 100vw, 568px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></a></figure>\n\n\n\n<h2><br>Sharing learning on accessibility can be a motivator </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Raghavendra underwent his most challenging event to date, when he had a kidney transplant. To motivate himself, he started a website that focuses on accessibility and inclusive design. This prompted him to start an accessibility community to help fill the gaps in accessibility knowledge. Today, it is one of India’s largest online accessibility communities, educating developers and designers and training people with disabilities to build a career in accessibility testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-6.jpg?resize=680%2C790&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Portrait photo of Raghavendra post his organ transplant, 2021.\" class=\"wp-image-13698\" width=\"680\" height=\"790\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-6.jpg?w=774&amp;ssl=1 774w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-6.jpg?resize=258%2C300&amp;ssl=1 258w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-6.jpg?resize=768%2C893&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 680px) 100vw, 680px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Raghavendra after his organ transplant in 2021</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Raghavendra is also a keen user of the WordPress Gutenberg editor and builds all his websites using it. Though content creation and editing can still pose him difficulties, he finds the front end of the Gutenberg blocks very accessible. He believes in participating in the software to make it a better experience for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I decided to live my life to the fullest and make my mark on the world.

He continues to enjoy working in-depth in disability, accessibility, and inclusion spaces. Raghavendra hopes others will join with him and the thousands of other people who collaborate to make a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Raghavendra Satish Peri (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/tarkham/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>tarkham</a>) for sharing his experiences for this latest edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Meher Bala (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>meher</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>webcommsat</a>) and Surendra Thakor (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>sthakor</a>) for interviews and writing this feature, to Mary Baum (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>lmurillom</a>) for reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>People of WordPress</em> series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\'https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\' class=\'mention\'><span class=\'mentions-prefix\'>@</span>topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\" style=\"grid-template-columns:29% auto\"><figure class=\"wp-block-media-text__media\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:43]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was so excited to learn that WordCamp would be on Halloween this year, and now it&#8217;s finally here. After a full day of workshops and mingling, I am exhausted. But I&#8217;ve got just enough time to return to the hotel and prepare for the after party. It&#8217;s a themed costume event organized by the Docs team, and I cannot wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking into my room, I give a big yawn and realize just how tired I am. The bed is looking extra comfortable right now. Surely a little nap wouldn&#8217;t hurt, right? As soon as my head hits the pillow, I&#8217;m out like a light, but almost immediately, my eyes snap back open, a flash of lightning lights up the room, and I hear rain pouring down outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:23]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After another flash, the lights in the room start to flicker. That&#8217;s strange, I think to myself, but I have an after party to get to. There must have been a power surge because when I look back at the clock, it&#8217;s reset and flashing 12:00 am. I check my phone, but it&#8217;s dead too. I&#8217;m not quite sure how long I&#8217;ve been sleeping, so I don&#8217;t know if I have enough time to change into my full Ninja Turtles costume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just put the mask on and head down to the lobby to meet my WordPress friends. When the elevator dings open in the lobby, it&#8217;s completely empty. No concierge, no hotel staff, and no WordPress friends. That&#8217;s weird. The lights also seem dimmer. And, are those urgent Trac tickets on the lobby lounge chairs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m wondering where everybody is, but I keep walking toward the convention hall. A shadow suddenly moves in the corner of my eye, and I spin around but only see my own face reflecting in a hallway mirror. Hmm, that&#8217;s odd. I notice that the cute Ninja Turtle mask looks a little less cute somehow. The eyes are angry red, and the teeth are now sharp-looking fangs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I can take off the mask for a closer look, I see another shadow move in the corner of the mirror. When I turn around this time, I see the faint outline of a person. It looks familiar. Could that be Matt Mullenweg? Darn it. They disappear into the convention hall before I can even call out, ‘howdy!’ And so I break into a jog to follow after them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking into the hall, I can hear the musical stylings of WordPress Jazzer Duke Ellington playing on a gramophone. I bob my head to the music, super relieved to see the room full of WordPressers dressed up and dancing. I head over to some of the folks from my Make team to chat, but oddly, they won&#8217;t stop dancing. They&#8217;re smiling and dancing and cheering each other on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of them are even doing the electric slide. It&#8217;s actually kind of impressive, but it&#8217;s still a little strange that no one will stop dancing to talk to me. Actually, now that I think about it, none of the party goers seem to be noticing me at all. Wondering what&#8217;s going on, I start backing up toward the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I jump a little as it slams behind me with the loud sound of an old door creaking and the heavy click of a lock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when I noticed the shadowy familiar figure again. This time they&#8217;re standing by an open door on the other side of the hall. They seem to be watching me. They lift a white gloved hand and motion for me to follow before disappearing through the door again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I run after the mysterious figure weaving between groups of dancing WordCamp goers. Could they be under a spell, I wonder while running past. I exit the convention space and enter a small hallway that seems to twist and turn. It feels a lot longer than I remember. I continue running through it and suddenly find myself back in the Contributor Day conference room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shadow person is nowhere to be found, and as I walk around the contributor tables, I quickly notice that the exit back to the hotel has also disappeared. Okay, so this is getting really weird. My first thought is to get my Make team involved, but since they won&#8217;t stop dancing, I know I need to devise a different plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when I noticed the big glass box at the center of the room. I am almost certain it wasn&#8217;t there during Contributor Day. I approach the box cautiously. Inside I see a shiny silver goblet of gently fizzing WordPress blue liquid, possibly blueberry flavored if I had to guess. Attached to the goblet stem is a ribbon with a note in EB Garamond that reads: Merge Me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, I chuckle at the poor attempt at a GitHub joke until I spot another note scrolled on the glass in black marker. It says,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bubble, bubble, toil, and trouble;</em><br><em>Find your escape route on the double;&nbsp;</em><br><em>Bring back the community and one thing more;&nbsp;</em><br><em>Merge the elixir with your core.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&#8217;m trying to decode the odd poem’s meaning, a flash of lightning lurches across the room, and a clap of thunder follows behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I shield my eyes before looking up to find that I am no longer alone. It&#8217;s the shadowy figure again, except in the light of this room, I can finally see that it&#8217;s not anyone familiar. It is a lumpy-looking being, and it&#8217;s wearing a witch costume. The costume-clad figure looks very unsteady on its feet like it might fall over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just as I&#8217;m about to ask if they&#8217;re all right, the person suddenly topples over into a heap of robes and broomsticks. I can see spots of yellow fur and a few pairs of fuzzy ears. Aha! There was a wisdom of Wapuus under that witchy costume.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They blink cutely at me for a moment and then quickly scurry into a surprisingly organized line. I watch, totally confused, as the line of Wapuus starts moving methodically back toward the convention hall. They take three steps, and then they turn to the side, take another three steps, and then turn to the other side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last Wapuu in the line turns to look at me and motions with its tiny paw to follow. That&#8217;s when the words on the glass box finally click. I have to bring the community back. All the dancing WordPressers need to return to the contributor tables to break the spell. The Wapuus have started a conga line to help lead the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, off I go. Following the tiny conga line through the twisting hallway and into the convention hall. As I&#8217;m dancing behind the Wapuus, I&#8217;m happy to see all my fellow WordCamp attendees falling into step behind me. My steadily growing conga line is weaving its way through the hall, picking up WordPressers, wearing mouse costumes, and Frankensteins and penguin costumes, and that&#8217;s when the Wapuus changed their course, leading us back through the twisting hallway and into the Contributor Day conference room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the first part of the riddle solved, I&#8217;m glad to see that everyone has finally stopped dancing. Some folks are happy to sit down and get off their feet. Others are wondering how they ended up back in the contributor room. My Make team waves at me from across the room. I noticed there&#8217;s still no exit, but the glass box has disappeared. With the goblet free, there&#8217;s just one thing left for me to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:27]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rush toward it, dodging Wapuus and a pile of kicked-off shoes. Except that the closer I think I&#8217;m getting to the goblet, the further away it feels. I run faster, weaving through people and tables, and just when I feel close enough to reach out for the goblet, I trip over a live-streaming cable, and I wake up in my hotel room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting up quickly, I realize it was all just a very strange dream. Outside, the sun is setting in a clear sky with no storm in sight. I try to shake it off. I change into my Ninja Turtles costume, ready to do my best Monster Mash at the after party with all of my WordPress friends. As I walk out of the hotel room, I pause for a quick costume check in the mirror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before heading downstairs, I take a quick glance at the digital clock on the nightstand to see the time. Huh, that&#8217;s odd. Next to the digital clock sits a fuzzy plush Wapuu wearing a witch costume. That wasn&#8217;t there before, was it? And if I didn&#8217;t know any better, I almost think I see it wink.&nbsp;</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13666\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:53:\"WordPress 6.1 Release Candidate 3 (RC3) Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-release-candidate-3/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 25 Oct 2022 20:29:49 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13670\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:427:\"WordPress 6.1 Release Candidate 3 is now available for testing!

That means the project would <em>greatly benefit from</em> your assistance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 is planned for official release on November 1st, 2022, two weeks from today.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>This version of the WordPress software is under development</strong>. Please do not install, run, or test this version of WordPress on production or mission-critical websites. Instead, it is recommended that you test RC2 on a test server and site.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can test WordPress 6.1 RC2 in three ways:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 1: </strong>Install and activate the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-beta-tester/\">WordPress Beta Tester</a> plugin (select the “Bleeding edge” channel and “Beta/RC Only” stream).</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 2: </strong>Direct download the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.1-RC2.zip\">RC2 version (zip)</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Option 3:</strong> Use the WP-CLI command:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><code>wp core update --version=6.1-RC2</code></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Additional information on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/6-1/\">6.1 release cycle is available here</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">Make WordPress Core blog</a> for <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/dev-notes+6-1/\">6.1-related developer notes</a> in the coming weeks detailing all upcoming changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>What’s in WordPress 6.1 RC2?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Since Release Candidate 1, approximately 65 items have been addressed, bringing the total count to more than 2,000 updates since WordPress 6.0 in May of 2022.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/commits/wp/6.1\">GitHub tickets</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=accepted&amp;status=closed&amp;changetime=10%2F11%2F2022..10%2F18%2F2022&amp;resolution=fixed&amp;milestone=6.1&amp;col=id&amp;col=summary&amp;col=status&amp;col=milestone&amp;col=owner&amp;col=type&amp;col=priority&amp;order=id\">Trac tickets</a>&nbsp;</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 is the third major release for 2022, following 5.9 and 6.0, released in January and May of this year, respectively.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the highlights for both end-users and developers, you’re invited to read more about them in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/wordpress-6-1-release-candidate-1-rc1-now-available/\">RC1 announcement post</a> and review the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/12/wordpress-6-1-field-guide/\">WordPress 6.1 Field Guide</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Plugin and theme developers</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>All plugin and theme developers should test their respective extensions against WordPress 6.1 RC2 and update the “<em>Tested up to”</em> version in their readme file to 6.1. If you find compatibility problems, please post detailed information to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/forum/alphabeta/\">support forums</a>, so these items can be investigated further prior to the final release date of November 1st.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Translate WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you speak a language other than English? <a href=\"https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp/dev\">Help translate WordPress into more than 100 languages.</a>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Keep WordPress bug-free – help with testing</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing for issues is critical for stabilizing a release throughout its development. Testing is also a great way to contribute. <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/2022/09/21/help-test-wordpress-6-1/\">This detailed guide</a> is an excellent start if you have never tested a beta release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Testing helps ensure that this and future releases of WordPress are as stable and issue-free as possible. Anyone can take part in testing – regardless of prior experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Want to know more about testing releases like this one?

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And today I have with me Nick Diego. Welcome, Nick, to the WordPress Briefing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:00:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you so much for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Before we get started, why don&#8217;t you tell me a bit about yourself, just kind of your history with WordPress and then what it is that you&#8217;ve been doing with the WordPress 6.1 release squad.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:00:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so I&#8217;m actually kind of new to working with WordPress full-time. Up until about June of last year, I was in the hospitality industry for a career of 10 years. But I always loved doing WordPress on the side. And after the long pandemic, I figured it was time to kind of pursue my passion and work with WordPress full-time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that ultimately led to my current role as a developer advocate at WPEngine, where I focus primarily on WordPress and contribution to Core itself. And then I guess it was maybe March or April this year when <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>, who I&#8217;ve worked with a ton, she asked me if I&#8217;d be interested in helping out on 6.0 as an Editor Triage Lead which was an awesome experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now I&#8217;m back for 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s excellent. I always like to hear about people who are coming to do repeat tours of duty.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:01:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:44]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I probably shouldn&#8217;t refer to working on WordPress releases as a tour of duty. However, I find that releases are so large and complex, and there are so many people in there now that working on them takes an entirely different skill set now than it used to take when WordPress was like 1% of the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think it&#8217;s a really big task, and I think it&#8217;s great when people were, like, that was either so good that I would do it again, or I would like a second go because I could do it better. Whichever way brings people to it. So, yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:02:18]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, I was just gonna say that&#8217;s a great point because the Editor Triage Lead, which is the role that I currently have, was a brand new role for 6.0. The project kind of got so big that it kind of made sense to have a triage lead focused specifically on Gutenberg. Gutenberg&#8217;s such a big part of WordPress now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s where that role kind of came from, and now we&#8217;ve carried it over to 6.1. As the project grows, we need more people to come in and help make sure the release is as smooth as it can be.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. Because of that promise of backward compatibility and all the things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:02:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:48]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cool. So, by the time this releases, if I recall correctly, we will have passed RC2, or RC2 is coming the next day or something like that. We&#8217;re right around the Release Candidate two. So you have been doing this for quite some time on this particular release. So far, what is the feature that you&#8217;re most excited about that&#8217;s going out in the 6.1 release?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:03:09]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, this is going to sound really boring, but it&#8217;s actually incredibly exciting. So, the most exciting quote-unquote feature that I&#8217;m excited about is the improved consistency and standardization of block controls that are coming in 6.1. So things like typography and color and borders and dimensions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are things and tools that we&#8217;ve had in a lot of core blocks, but it hasn&#8217;t been consistent throughout. And a ton of work has been done in 6.1 to establish that consistency. We&#8217;re not a hundred percent there, but typography, I think we&#8217;re at like 85% of all core blocks now support all the typography controls, and with each release as we head to 6.2, we&#8217;ll improve on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But it&#8217;s really great for theme builders, theme designers, and users to be able to control the look and feel blocks consistently throughout the editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was gonna immediately answer you earlier with like, there are no boring answers, there are no boring improvements. And as you were explaining why it is that you kind of thought it might be considered boring, I think it&#8217;s fair to say that anytime that you&#8217;re increasing the consistency and you&#8217;re increasing the confidence between what you saw on the back end and what you actually shipped on the front end– anytime you&#8217;re doing that, I think that that is exciting in the prove the negative way.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you think about the negative excitement that occurs when you have published something, and it looks one way in the back end, and then it looks totally different on the front end, and the panic you feel when you have to fix. Not having that is a really big step up, I think. And so anything that provides more consistency for people who are using WordPress, people who are building with WordPress, I always find exciting. But also, like, I&#8217;m an office person, and so I would find office things exciting, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:04:53]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It creates a more delightful experience. I do a lot of work on the Training team, doing educational things, and we teach people how to change typography and change color. Once they learn how to do it in one block, if they can take that same skill set and apply it to any other block, it&#8217;s that light bulb moment. They understand they know how to manipulate and use WordPress to its fullest. So adding that consistency really helps to level up users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m gonna take us off track a little bit and just ask a general question here. Like, I remember the first time that I was working with what was a site, I guess, qualified for a site at the time. And I remember the first time that I discovered that I could change the look and feel with HTML and CSS, and I did that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also was like, well, I accept my fate. Whatever happens, if I kill everything I&#8217;ve ever written, that is just how it&#8217;ll be. Like the sheer terror of all of that is so different now. Do you recall that first moment where you&#8217;re like, Oh, I do have some power over this? I have some control over this, and whether you also found it scary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:05:52]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I came to WordPress kinda as a hobby and website development kind of as a hobby. So I was kind of always in that tinkering phase, or I wasn&#8217;t building something for anyone else. I was in a safe place to destroy whatever I was working on with my tinkering. So I never really quite had that fear, but I can definitely see it from the perspective of building something for somebody else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you&#8217;re right, the editor and the controls that we have, and you know, now make it a lot easier to kind of manipulate and exert your creative desires in WordPress than it was before with CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:23]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love the phrase ‘I was safe to destroy things, ’ and if I can figure out a way to make it a tagline for something, I will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:31]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright. So during your second time around here on the release squad with 6.1, what have been the bright spots of that experience, and have there been any unexpected challenges of being on the release squad?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:06:44]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Again, I come to WordPress from, you know, from a different career. It&#8217;s kind of a passion of mine to be working with WordPress. So I kinda have a unique experience than maybe some others. And when I approach WordPress, there&#8217;s always that tendency to say, ‘why doesn&#8217;t it do this?’ Or ‘why don&#8217;t they do this?’ And I&#8217;ve always been the person…, well, it&#8217;s open source. We, we, we can, we can</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…can do it</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:07:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…we can do it. And so that&#8217;s kind of how I approach things. Now, of course, you know, I have the privilege of time to do that. Not everybody does, but one of the unexpected bright spots about working in a release squad is understanding how it all works.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How does WordPress actually get built? What is the process that it goes through? It was just eye-opening to me, and I really got a shout-out, Anne, for inviting me to be on 6.0. It brought me in. I learned so much about it, and now I&#8217;m just excited to keep working on these releases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But a release is hard. You know, it&#8217;s a… WordPress is huge. There are a lot of moving parts, there are a lot of things going on. Right now, we&#8217;re trying to get everything ready for the first release candidate. So being on the release squad is not an easy job. But it&#8217;s exciting, it&#8217;s fun, and you really feel like you&#8217;re part of that ‘we’ really helping to build WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:53]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I hope that people have learned from any time that they spent working with me is that like we understand here in the WordPress open source project, and I believe that all open source projects must understand this, but like every change that you make, if there are things that are dependent on it, which is gonna be true for most of us, we&#8217;ll have intended consequences and also unexpected consequences, and unintended, unexpected consequences.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ve always felt like the thing that really makes the biggest difference about how we do open source in WordPress is that, for the most part, we have a concept of where the most likely changes are going to happen across our entire ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have a better understanding, at least compared to when I got here, a better understanding of how interconnected it all is. And so you&#8217;ve got this change here, and it looks small, but it&#8217;s gonna have this positive or negative impact as you kind of work your way out from it. And so I think that that is an interesting thing, and certainly, you get a really clear concept of it in the release squad, I think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:09:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, absolutely. If you were to build something like the block editor without caring at all about backward compatibility, you&#8217;d be done by now, right? I mean, so much of what we do is concerning ourselves with making sure that everybody who&#8217;s on a classic theme or hybrid theme or whatever it might be that they continue to use WordPress in a safe and stable way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is part of being such a large content management system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you already told us the feature that you&#8217;re most excited about, and so now I&#8217;m gonna ask you about what feature or what bug fix has the most notable improvements that are coming to 6.1. This is a little different as in, like, there&#8217;s the thing you&#8217;re excited about, which is an office thing, but like a thing that is maybe not new but has the biggest delta, the biggest change to anyone&#8217;s experience of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, so obviously, in 5.9, we introduced full site editing, and 6.0 was a natural progression from that with more and more features. Now it&#8217;s safe to say that there&#8217;s only a small fraction of websites that are using the whole full site editing of or block themes, all that kind of stuff. One of the hangups about that was managing templates inside of the site editor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You could add the files to your theme, which would then show up in the site editor. But there wasn&#8217;t a direct way to add more complicated templates within the site editor itself. That is changing in 6.1. So now you actually have the functionality to install something like 2023, which is the new core theme, and build out all these very complicated templates within the UI of the site editor that you could not have done before.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:10:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I personally think that the biggest benefit of full site editing is really to empower no-code or low-code users. And the ability to add these templates directly in the UI really levels them up. Because now, you can do all that complicated stuff that you normally would need to be adding to theme files and jumping into the code. You can do that within the site editor now, which I think is fantastic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s great. And just a general caveat, anytime that we talk about anything that&#8217;s very developer-y or very no code-y, I think it&#8217;s always worth mentioning, yes, a lot of what we&#8217;re trying to do with the block editor is to just kind of give some power back to folks who cannot find the time to become a developer or don&#8217;t have the inclination. They don&#8217;t want to do that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that does not mean that no code is ever involved in WordPress. It&#8217;s still a software. You can still do very complicated things with it. And if you are a developer, you should not think to yourself, ‘oh now that it&#8217;s being available to low code/no code users, that means you don&#8217;t want me.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like, that&#8217;s not at all what&#8217;s happening. You can do very complicated things still.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:11:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A hundred percent. A hundred percent. Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alright, so that brings us to our final question here because we like to stay as true to the name as possible here on the WP Briefing. If someone were wanting to get involved with the next release, so WP 6.2, how would they do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:12:01]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, talk to Anne, and she&#8217;ll get you set up. No, I&#8217;m just kidding. So at the, after each release, there&#8217;s a posting that goes out that lists all the different release teams, and you can just put your name out there and ask to be, you know, for consideration to be part of the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, I will say that the best thing you can do right now is help with 6.1. You don&#8217;t necessarily need to be a release lead to do that testing, helping with bug fixes. Reach out to me. Reach out to other release leads, and we&#8217;ll get you involved and engaged with the release. That will give you a really good framework to start working and become a release lead for 6.2.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I think we talked maybe two or three episodes ago, or it could be more than that, I&#8217;ll never know, about the release squad, like the group that&#8217;s doing that. In the event you think to yourself, ‘there&#8217;s no way in a million years that I&#8217;m gonna just show up tomorrow and be part of the release squad,’ I heard what they said in the first question/answer moment– that&#8217;s fine, too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Nick mentioned, you can always get involved with testing, you can get involved with triage. Those are areas where any feedback at all is valuable because we can get better information about what worked and didn&#8217;t, what was expected versus what happened. And that type of information is where all of our co-creators of the WordPress software–really, we rely on what you all are pointing out to us.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re not shining spotlights on the most painful parts of your experience, sometimes we don&#8217;t necessarily know that that&#8217;s a pain point for anyone.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:34]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so yeah, that&#8217;s a great place to start. If you are more of a writer, technical or prose, there are different spaces you can go to, like keep our docs up to date or make sure that people know that changes are coming at all in WordPress because that&#8217;s a thing. If you are a backend developer, we have a million things you can do because that&#8217;s just all day, every day, for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s just all the deep backend work. And so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:13:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did want to mention that, you know, being on the release team does not necessarily mean that you&#8217;re incredibly technical. We have a documentation lead, we have a design lead, you know, a communication lead. So there&#8217;s a lot of different roles in the team that, you know, across all disciplines.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So don&#8217;t think if you&#8217;re not a hardcore developer, that precludes you from being on the team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you&#8217;re really good with common sense and working fully remotely, you can be the release coordinator. I can tell you because I did that for 5.0. It was a big job. It was our, it was the first time we had a release squad as opposed to just like the release lead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because there was just so much that was going into that and so much riding on it. And like you said in some other answer that you gave like if you were to just be like, we&#8217;re shutting everything down and rewriting this in six months, and I hope you can come with us on it. Like a lot of open source projects do it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:51]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that is a choice, and we made the opposite choice. And so we&#8217;re bringing all of our co-conspirators with us, all of our co-creators of WordPress. That&#8217;s the hope all the time. Making sure that they have enough information, that they feel safe to destroy things, enough information, and skills about how to get out of it, that they always feel some high confidence in what they&#8217;re trying to do versus what they actually did do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, excellent. Nick, do you have any final thoughts for our listeners?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Nick Diego 00:15:20]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nope. I just hope everybody goes out and downloads 6.1 and enjoys it as much as I am.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:25]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, go check it out.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. And actually, it is a pretty big list today, but still pretty big things too. So first up, we have a call for testing that is out, and it is for our Android users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is a call for testing for WordPress for Android 20.9, and I feel like we don&#8217;t get a lot of calls for testing for Android devices. And so if you have been feeling left out or just like we don&#8217;t always have that kind of mobile testing available, this is the opportunity for you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing is that tomorrow, we have RC2, release candidate two for WordPress 6.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s coming out on October 18th. There will be a link in the show notes, but that means if you write a plugin or a theme or have anything that kind of extends the core of WordPress, now is the time to start testing anything that might be a bug or represent a breaking change and make sure that you file those bugs so that we can get things as settled and excellent as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of Word points, uh, WordPress 6.1, not Word point, WordPress 6.1. I actually have three changes that I think are going to represent some pretty big changes for folks. I will have links to all of these in the show notes. If you don&#8217;t know where the show notes are, it&#8217;s on wordpress.org/news/podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the three things that I think are gonna be big, worthwhile things. The first one is multisite improvements, and the second one will be the style engine that&#8217;s block styles generation tool, which will ship in Core and I think is really important for y&#8217;all to take a look at. And then also there are some changes coming to the block editor preferences.<br><br>Like I said, links to all of those are going to be in the show notes, and so they should be pretty easy for you to find. But also, if you want to just get a general look at everything that&#8217;s coming in 6.1, we did a walkthrough that I will link to in the show notes as well, and you can get a full understanding of what is going to be coming early in November.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list –big list– of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13578\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:7:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"The Month in WordPress – September 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:73:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/10/the-month-in-wordpress-september-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 14 Oct 2022 10:07:36 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13596\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:179:\"September was an exciting month with the return of many in-person WordCamps, WordPress Translation Day, and preparations for WordPress 6.1.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I have with us today on the WordPress Briefing a couple of special guests. I have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ironprogrammer/\">Brian Alexander</a>, as well as <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\">Anne McCarthy</a>. I&#8217;m gonna ask you both to tell us a little bit about yourselves, if you can tell us what you do with the WordPress project, maybe how long you&#8217;ve been with WordPress, and if there are any particular teams that you contribute to, that would be great.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, why don&#8217;t you get us started?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:01:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Brian. I work on the WordPress project as a full-time contributor, sponsored by Automattic. And I am one of the Test Team reps, so I help promote testing across the project. And that&#8217;s not just in Core, but it could be for Themes, Performance, feature plugins, what have you. So try to make that stuff move forward and wrangle as many people as we can to get on board and help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. All right, and Anne, what about you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:01:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I spearhead the Full Site Editing outreach program. I am a sponsor contributor for Automattic as well, and so I contribute across a couple of different teams depending upon what the outreach program needs as well as various release squads I have been a part of. So for 6.1 coming up, I&#8217;m one of the co-Core Editor triage leads.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian is also on the squad as the co-Test lead, which is very exciting. So it&#8217;s been fun to work with him and be on the podcast. And I&#8217;ve been around the WordPress project since about 2011. But this is, the last couple of years, the first time I&#8217;ve been able to be sponsored by Automattic and be a part of giving back to the community that&#8217;s given me so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Amazing. All right. For folks who&#8217;ve been listening to the WP Briefing for a while, you know that I&#8217;ve been saying for like a full year that I think that testing is one of the best onboarding opportunities we have. And then also I really like to bring in our co-creators of WordPress through that testing program. Because we don&#8217;t know whether we&#8217;re right or not unless people tell us that we&#8217;re right or not. And we would like to hear so much from the users who, you know, use it and don&#8217;t necessarily have an opportunity, that privilege to kind of build on it or build the CMS itself.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just have a few questions since I&#8217;ve got a couple of our strong testing wranglers here. The first thing I have is what are you doing? Or, do you have any advice for getting people outside of our active contributor base and the community to participate in testing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:03:03]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I can kick this off. Just thinking about the Full Site Editing outreach program model. So just for context, there are various calls for testing in different formats. So everything from really procedural where you&#8217;re following exact steps to follow, to very open-ended calls for testing, as well as we recently did usability testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things that come to mind immediately just for getting different contributors is to have very specific, fun, engaging, relevant tests that can draw people in. So if you have a call for testing that really speaks to someone, they might be more willing to participate. As well as just different formats.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So someone may not want to, you know, follow 30 steps, but they might want to follow something more open-ended. They might want to answer a survey rather than opening a GitHub link. And so I think a lot of facilitation with the outreach program has served us really well to bring in different folks as well as explicitly reaching out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;ve done a number of talks in different WordPress related spaces and non-WordPress spaces to try to tell people about what we&#8217;re up to and really go meet them where they are. Because I think that&#8217;s ultimately, especially with Covid and the pandemic, there was a really unique opportunity to do that and to join the random online meetup that was happening and talk about the program and talk about ways that people could get involved and feel heard.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:04:12]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the last thing I&#8217;ll mention is translations. The program that&#8217;s culture testing that I write is written in English, but I&#8217;m very fortunate to have people who translate those. And so that&#8217;s a huge way that I cannot contribute but that other people have. And so I really want to highlight that and call that out because it&#8217;s been hugely impactful to have these calls for testing in a way that people can more readily access.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:04:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I was going to add in, in addition to the calls for testing that are, as Anne said, structured such to isolate so that someone can just kind of go through a list of steps to do rather than just being exposed to Trac or GitHub and have kind of snow blindness with, with everything that&#8217;s happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a Week in Test series of posts that goes out about every week. And what we try to do with that series is to curate a list of posts that might be a good starting point. So we try to find one that, in each type of testing example, is something that would, a more novice contributor might be able to start with. Things for more intermediate and then also advanced ones that, for testers who may need to have a development environment and the ability to make some pretty deep or type of customizations to their WordPress project in order to test a patch or reproduce a particular issue that might be happening.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s a good springboard for someone to come in where there&#8217;s just a small thing that they can kind of look at and then dive into the larger process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Absolutely. That&#8217;s very smart. It&#8217;s hard to figure out how to get started in WordPress at all, let alone as a contributing by testing things sort of area. That feels new to WordPress even though the team has been around for a long time. And so I think that&#8217;s excellent.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brian, you mentioned in your note about who you are and what you&#8217;re doing that you&#8217;re helping with testing not only in the test section in the Test Team but then also across the project. So, I have a follow-up question for you. What can developers do to create better tests for their software?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:06:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are sections within the Core handbook that kind of go into detail about the types of tests that should accompany individual contributions. A lot of those require kind of an extra step, and some developers maybe don&#8217;t have as much experience there. So hopefully, the Core handbook can provide a little bit of that guidance.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also have a lot of contributors who are interested in things such as unit testing, E2E testing, which is end-to-end testing, and testing in JavaScript or in PHP. So there&#8217;s a wide variety of the types of tests that you can actually contribute to. And I would say maybe about 50% of the tickets that I&#8217;ve triaged, personally, the contributor who brought in the patch was unable to or was not familiar with providing unit tests. So that is a very good opportunity for someone to come in who maybe is not as well versed in the depth of what the patch was involved with. But by contributing a user test, they get an opportunity to look very focused at a particular piece of code, what was modified, and then create unit tests based on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:07:40]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then once that unit test has been submitted and starting to be reviewed, other reviewers, Core contributors, or Core committers, I would say, they&#8217;ll start looking at that and if there are additional details that should be there, expanding the tests or little modifications. Then that also is feedback to that test contributor so that the next time they come in, they&#8217;re more prepared for it. They&#8217;re learning more about Core, and eventually, maybe they&#8217;ll also become a Core contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:07]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Excellent. We will include links to these handbook pages and documentation in the show notes if you&#8217;re listening to the podcast on your favorite podcasting platform, Pocketcasts, or it&#8217;s somewhere else. I don&#8217;t know where people listen to podcasts, but if you&#8217;re listening to it somewhere that&#8217;s not on the website, you can come to get that on wordpress.org/news.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, the next question that I have, and I think this is for both of you, Brian, it sounds like you partially answered it, but I bet there are more answers from Anne as well. What advice do you have for those submitting bug reports?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:08:38]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ll chime in to start, and then Brian, I&#8217;d love to hear your unique take because I also think you do an excellent job whenever I&#8217;ve engaged with you in various places of providing really good replication steps. And so I love that, and I wanna offer things specific to WordPress itself and something that I&#8217;ve noticed that&#8217;s more cultural rather than necessarily like steps to follow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And one of the things I&#8217;ve noticed that I think has started to come up partially with Covid is people, you know, you start talking at WordCamps or at a meetup, and a bug comes up, and you find someone who knows where to put it, and that kind of connection is has been frayed in the last couple years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so one of the things I feel like I&#8217;ve been saying to a lot of different people at this unique point in time is that it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. Don&#8217;t let perfect be the enemy of good. And so if it means you just need to drop it in a Slack channel and you just are like, I don&#8217;t know where to put this, that&#8217;s huge.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to hear from people across the project. And I just really encourage anyone, even if you don&#8217;t have the complete information or you&#8217;re not a hundred percent sure you&#8217;re afraid it&#8217;s been reported 10 times before, like, please still report it because we need those reports and also if 10 people reported it and it&#8217;s still not fixed, that also means we need to iterate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:09:40]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s one of the things, especially with the Full Site Editing outreach program, I feel people will message me saying, hey, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve heard this a bunch, but… And sometimes I&#8217;ve never heard it at all. And I shudder to think of all the people who have not reached out or have not posted in GitHub or Trac or wherever.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, share, and write blog posts. I think that another great way that people can give feedback is if you don&#8217;t know how to get into the depths of WordPress, writing a post and talking about it and sharing it on social media is also a great way to get attention. I read a lot of those. But as much as possible, getting to, if you can, if you&#8217;re comfortable, getting to the source where we&#8217;re able to see it in Github or Trac goes a really long way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And share as much as you can. And don&#8217;t worry if you can&#8217;t spend hours writing the perfect bug report, we still wanna hear from you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:10:21]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Building off of what Anne said, just the fact that you&#8217;re speaking out and raising an issue is a huge step for many, many people. And once, once you&#8217;ve actually done that, as Anne said, it doesn&#8217;t need to be perfect. There are a lot of other people who are going to be looking at these bugs, trying to figure out the replication steps used.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So even if you can&#8217;t provide all this detail up front, someone will help. On the back end, they&#8217;ll help kind of fill in those gaps. If you do have the time to actually get deep into providing a very detailed bug report, then there are some key aspects of the bug report that make it very helpful for contributors, not only testers, who should be able to reproduce the issue to validate and make sure that this isn&#8217;t something that&#8217;s unique, unique to a plugin, to a custom theme or snippet that you dropped into your functions PHP.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, also for the actual Core contributors, who then need to be able to understand what is happening so that they can fix the right thing. And some of those items are the information about your testing environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that could be your browser, your server, the type, whether it&#8217;s Apache, Nginx, et cetera, the operating system you&#8217;re running, what version of PHP you&#8217;re running, the version of WordPress, very critical, and…&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:49]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Super important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:11:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any themes and plugins that you&#8217;re using. And that kind of information helps set the stage, and then other people will be able to set up their environment similarly if they&#8217;re going to try to test it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After you have provided the environmental information, the steps required to reproduce the issue should be as detailed as possible. You may not have realized that clicking this caused such and such to happen, so just try to remember, or maybe even walk through if it&#8217;s something you can repeat multiple times, walk through a couple of times and write down everything that you&#8217;re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:12:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that you&#8217;re sure, hey, this is the way that I can reproduce this bug. And then those steps will be very helpful for other contributors when they&#8217;re reviewing it. And then it&#8217;s also very helpful if you have video, screenshots, debug logs, any of those other kinds of resources that you could refer to because not all bugs are easy to explain.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we tend to… Trac and GitHub issues for the Gutenberg project, everybody&#8217;s writing in English. And maybe your main language is not English, and it might be a little bit challenging to do that. So providing a video, it&#8217;s worth a thousand words in any language. So, if you can provide those types of assets, that&#8217;s also very important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and I&#8217;ll share a little bit of a you&#8217;re-not-alone-in-it sort of anecdotes from the first few bugs that I ever filed for WordPress. I sort of had this feeling that if I were to file a bug, everyone would know that I wasn&#8217;t a developer. And like everyone knows, I&#8217;m not a developer, but a little bit I was like, they&#8217;ll know now. And so if that&#8217;s where you are also,&nbsp; Anne said it, and Brian said it as well, like, we can&#8217;t fix things that we don&#8217;t realize are broken. And just because you&#8217;ve run into it 15 times, which obviously should never happen, you should run into it once, and then we know, but it happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you run into it 15 times, probably other people have as well. And if it&#8217;s still not fixed, it might be because no one has thought to themselves I should tell someone that&#8217;s broken. And so if that&#8217;s your primary hurdle, folks out there in our listening space, I was once there too. And honestly, knowing that it&#8217;s a problem is as valuable as knowing the solution to it most of the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:14:23]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and those are, I wanted to add, there is a lot to that to remember. That&#8217;s a lot to remember in terms of what you should be submitting, what, or I should say, what would be ideal in what you&#8217;re submitting. But luckily, in the test handbook, there&#8217;s a test report section, and it includes a description, it goes everything from, it starts with why we do bug reports to examples of the types of testing, whether it be for bugs or enhancements, which also need testing, and it has templates in there that you can copy and paste directly into Trac. And that&#8217;s very helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah,, we will have links to those in the show notes as well. Since we&#8217;re right there at that moment, what do you think we could do as WordPress to make reporting problems easier?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:15:15]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know that this has been something that&#8217;s come up during our weekly meetings, discussions on the Core test channel, as well as in contributor day test table discussions. And the test documentation that&#8217;s on the website is a little bit fragmented. I believe that the current test handbook was originally written for a type of flow analysis and feedback testing that is not the norm today. So it&#8217;s a little bit confusing. The terminology is a little dated, and the most recent updates that have been provided on there relate solely to Gutenberg, which is very important that that also be represented, but, in order to find information about testing and Trac or PHP unit tests, you have to go over to the core handbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we could definitely make things improved by consolidating, bringing everything into one area so that if you are interested in testing, you&#8217;ll have everything in one place and not be split between that and not have outdated methodologies that are asking you to submit videos that nobody&#8217;s going to really look at because we&#8217;re not doing the flow tests anymore. So I think that that would be a benefit to future testers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:16:41]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne, any thoughts?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:16:43]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I&#8217;ll also add that I think there are like two things we can do. One is, there&#8217;s so much happening in the WordPress project in such a cool way that I think the more we can write targeted tests and talk to people about, like, hey, here&#8217;s this new thing coming. This is a high-impact area to test. It&#8217;s under active iteration. You&#8217;re gonna get a lot of engagement. People are really thinking about this and pulling people into that where you kind of get the momentum of getting the feedback in right when someone needs it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think we could do that a bit more to make reporting problems easier because it&#8217;s kind of like you&#8217;re in the thick of it with a lot of people rather than maybe exploring an area where someone hasn&#8217;t looked at it in a minute.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that’s the thing that comes to mind is just the more we can take the time. I think this release cycle has been really good with that, where there&#8217;s been a call for testing for fluid typography. There&#8217;s also been one for using block template parts and classic themes. And there&#8217;s a ton of stuff that&#8217;s been happening where we can kind of make these both developer and more end user testing experiences easier and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And Brian has done a great job continuing the tradition of, you know, helping test this latest release cycle. And he&#8217;s taken those posts and done an amazing job of helping, having specific testing as well. Tied to this, I think just this has always been a thing but better, easier testing environments for developers and for quickly setting up more WordPress sites to test things for end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:17:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Another thing that we have been discussing in Slack in the Core and Core Test channels is the possibility of pre-populating the Trac tickets. With a template based on what it is that you&#8217;re reporting. So similar to copying a template for a test report out of the handbook. Instead, you would hit a button to say the type of bug you are submitting, and then it would pre-populate that, and then you could fill in the gaps for that. This already happens over in Gutenberg. There, there are templates, and I find that that is very helpful. And so being able to do that in Trac would be useful.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then for reporting problems on the user side, I thought that it would be interesting to have like you have for any other modern app, a button that says Report Bug in WordPress that could capture some intelligence data for your installation, the page that you&#8217;re on and have a simple text box where you could provide a little description and then submit that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:19:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, these wouldn&#8217;t be the types of things that would just go straight into Trac, most likely. However, it would be an opportunity to allow end users to just send something in, and start having it looked at, rather than looking and saying, okay, I found a bug in WordPress. Now, what do I do?&nbsp; And then not reporting.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that would be the worst case is that the bug just doesn&#8217;t get reported. So that would be information that is already harvested if you go to your site health screen and your WordPress installation. A lot of that information that would be useful is there. In this type of bug report, we would want to anonymize and strip a lot of that information out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a lot of private stuff you don&#8217;t wanna share, but there is that data there that&#8217;s available that could potentially help in doing a bug report.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:19:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brilliant. All right. Question for everyone in the room: what opportunities are there currently to help with testing? Anne, I know, and you already mentioned a few, we can just bombard everybody with links to the tests if we want. But yeah, what opportunities are currently out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:20:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;ll mention the Full Site Editing outreach program. I&#8217;m very biased, but we&#8217;re always looking for new folks. We just crossed, I think, 600 people, which was unbelievable. So even if you&#8217;re not necessarily always able to help join the calls for testing, you can always pop into the FSE outreach experiment channel, which we&#8217;ll also add a link to.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s just a great way when you have time to join because I flag stuff all the time, whether it&#8217;s about the outreach program or just in general across the project. Brian does really good weekly round-up testing posts as well. So make.wordpress.org/test is also a great place to get started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then right now, I think when this comes out, will be a great time to be helping test WordPress 6.1. So check out that post. I kind of wanna just shove everyone in that direction currently cause I think that&#8217;s the most high-impact thing to get involved with and one of the great ways to give back to the next version of WordPress to make it really delightful and easy to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I&#8217;m just gonna leave it there, even though there are so many ways you can help.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:21:11]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 coming out on November 1st if you haven&#8217;t yet heard about it. Brian, what else have you got out there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:21:16]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of the online stuff, Anne covered that pretty well. I would say if you have a local WordCamp, sign up for their contributor day or if there are any local WordPress meetups. When Covid ended up hitting and lockdowns were rolled out, a lot of this stuff started to really slow down. So I think now is a good time to maybe introduce the idea for, hey, let&#8217;s have a local meetup, and for a couple of hours, we&#8217;ll just do some testing, and look at some stuff in WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it might be a good way of getting people re-engaged. It&#8217;s a little bit lighter weight if you&#8217;re doing testing versus trying to actually provide a patch to fix an issue. So, might be a good way of bringing in some new faces and re-engaging people who we lost over the lockdown.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:22:09]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, and if you all have never done a testing party for WordPress before, and it sounds like it&#8217;s maybe a really boring thing, it&#8217;s actually not, she said with strong authority and opinions. But also, I have never had a more successful learning experience with the WordPress CMS than when I was trying to figure it out with other people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They see things that you don&#8217;t see, they know things you don&#8217;t know, and it really covers a lot of the bases for unknown unknowns when you&#8217;re trying to learn something. And then also you have all these people that like, we’re really in it with you, and everyone&#8217;s really pulling for each other, and it&#8217;s actually a bit more fun than it sounds like when you&#8217;re just like, a testing party. It turns into just like jointly solving a puzzle together, which I think sounds like a lot of fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s like a party, but for technology, I would feel this way. I am a mad extrovert, and we all know it, but. Now you two know it as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:08]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a final, just like a fun question for you both, and if you have an answer, great. And if you don&#8217;t have an answer, I would be surprised.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So here we go. Last question of the day. If five more volunteers suddenly appeared to help on the Test Team, what would they do? Just, I waved a magic wand. I guess that&#8217;s what made it fun. I don&#8217;t know why. I was like, fun question and then I&#8217;m, like, assigned tasks that, Yeah, I waved a magic wand. That&#8217;s what made it fun.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:38]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, I would say I would probably point them to FSE outreach program posts because…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:23:45]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Woot woot.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:23:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>…the outreach program does a great job of outlining steps. You&#8217;re isolating testing in one particular area. It&#8217;s got a lot of tests. There&#8217;s examples of the types of feedback that you&#8217;re looking for, et cetera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a really good introduction to it, and most FSE testing does not require a local dev environment. Which is probably the biggest hurdle for a new tester coming in. If you do have developers with more experience, then they could start–and they wanted to look into Trac tickets or GitHub issues– then it does take a little bit of setup and you may spend the next few hours configuring your development environment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So instead, I would recommend that you start with something like FSE outreach program posts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I did not pay Brian to say that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:24:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We&#8217;re just all partial to it here. That&#8217;s all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:24:45]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, we really are. Yeah, no, this is, I love this question, and I actually find it really fun cause I think about it a lot. And we&#8217;ve talked about some of this stuff too, and it&#8217;s something that when I think about five more people suddenly appearing, makes me giddy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because we have folks, who have helped with like, I think I&#8217;ve mentioned like translations and group testing and even responding to questions that come from the channel and like, I just wish if we had five folks full time dedicated to that, I could see way more hallway hangouts where we casually talk about stuff and actually go on a call and talk live.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could see folks, someone dedicated to helping translations and translating even more places. We have an Italian contributor who does it regularly, and a couple of Japanese contributors every once in awhile we get Spanish translation. But I&#8217;d love to see more translations to bring more people in, more facilitating group testing, more types of testing, helping me be more creative because sometimes I get a creative wall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But more than anything, if I really think long term about the project and thinking about this outreach program model, which I don&#8217;t think I fully appreciated how new it was, Josepha, when you introduced the idea, I think it would be so neat to bring in more folks to actually create new outreach programs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:25:52]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program for theme authors or block theme authors, or maybe there&#8217;s an outreach program around collaborative editing. Like what does this look like, and how can we expand this to bring more people in? And I think a lot of that will prove the resiliency and lessons we&#8217;ve learned from Covid in the WordPress community.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We can&#8217;t necessarily always rely on the meetup groups, so how can we meet people where they are? And I think there&#8217;s something really interesting and almost serendipitous that the outreach program started literally, I think it was like May 2020, like a couple of months into the pandemic.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I, like, I want to see it in a position of strength where we both have the in-person community alongside this outreach program model that can intertwine work. And I&#8217;d love to see the model expand to different types. And right now, maybe part of that is we use the outreach program model, the full site editing outreach program group itself, to experiment more and to keep that level of experimentation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s something I feel really strongly about is continuing to find what works and what doesn&#8217;t. And so if we had five more people, I could just, I&#8217;d probably go wild and have all sorts of cool, cool things and spinoffs, but I&#8217;m more introverted than Josepha, so there&#8217;s limitations to this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:26:56]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you heard it here first. If you&#8217;re one of my 6,000 listeners. I only need five of one of you. Five of the ones of you to come and make Anne&#8217;s whole life an exciting joy for the next 12 months. So, I only need five of you and I know that you&#8217;re out there. There are 2000 or something, 6,000. I have no idea.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;ve got more than 1000 of you listening, and I know that you wanna come and help Anne cuz she&#8217;s a delight. I know you wanna come help Brian cuz he&#8217;s a delight. Both of you. This was such a fun conversation. Thank you for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Brian Alexander 00:27:29]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you, Josepha. Thank you, Anne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Anne McCarthy 00:27:31]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Thank you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:27:33]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there it is a bit of a deep dive on the Test Team and how to get started on it. Like I mentioned, we&#8217;ll have a ton of links in the show notes over on wordpress.org/news. And I wanna remind folks that if you have questions or thoughts that you&#8217;d like to hear from me about, you can always email us at WPbriefing@wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:27:58]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That brings us now to our small list of big things. First and foremost, we are counting down the days to the WordPress 6.1 release. We are within a month of the target release date. So if you have not tested the latest version with your plugins or themes, now is the time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Secondly, we are seeing translated tutorials being submitted on learn.wordpress.org. I&#8217;m delighted to see that happening, and I encourage any polyglots out there who feel called to consider translating one into your language and help other people feel empowered to use WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing is that the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India just concluded, so to celebrate, we&#8217;ve opened registrations for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in Latin America. Unlike the last one, this event takes place in person on October 29th. And so I&#8217;ll include a link to registrations for that in the show notes as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thanks for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosey, and I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13551\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:69:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:34:\"WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 Now Available\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:70:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/wordpress-6-1-beta-2-now-available/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Tue, 27 Sep 2022 18:12:30 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:5:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3:\"6.1\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"development\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"releases\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13533\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:306:\"WordPress 6.1 Beta 2 is now available for download and testing.\n\nThis version of the WordPress software is under development.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For folks who are new to WordPress in the past couple of years, you may have heard people talk about WordPress events with a sort of passion that really is hard to describe. For me, I know our events are the dark matter of what makes this global, fully distributed, multifaceted project come together so well in the end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also know that WordPressers have so many different reasons for coming together. So we took a little wander through WordCamp US to get their take on why they use WordPress and also why they go to WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So WordCamp US is back in person for the first time since 2019. What are you most excited about?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:01:19]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am Topher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Seeing everyone, the interpersonal relationships, the communication, the expressions on people&#8217;s faces that you don&#8217;t get via email or Slack or whatever. Just being near people again and enjoying each other&#8217;s company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jen Miller 00:01:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Jen Miller.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was most excited to see my friends. It&#8217;s been a long time to try to maintain connections via social media and, you know, texting and phone calls. But being here and being a part of the WordPress community has made everything great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:01:54]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Courtney Robertson.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributor day, of course, that&#8217;s how I got really connected to the WordPress community. And I am hoping we have a great turnout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How long have you been a contributor to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Kathy Drewien 00:02:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hi, I&#8217;m Kathy Drewien.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started in 2008 by attending my first WordCamp. Two years later, I was part of the organizing team for WordCamp Atlanta. I have been on that team for one role or another. Well, I can&#8217;t tell you how many years now. From then, until now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alex Stine 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Alex Stine. About six years now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Topher 00:02:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>About 12 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started going to WordCamp, then working in the support forums, and just grew from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Courtney Robertson 00:02:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started checking guests in, at my first WordCamp in 2009, which I see as one avenue of contributing. I joined a team officially in 2014.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:02:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Courtney Patubo Kranzke.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have been an on-and-off contributor to WordPress since like the mid-2000s, but I&#8217;ve been a sponsored contributor since 2016.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin Hartzler </strong><strong>00:03:02]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Dustin Hartzler.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started a WordPress podcast in 2010. And I did like 500 episodes in a row without a break and without a week worth of rest. So I consider that my contribution to WordPress. I have a couple of core contributions, like I, I fixed a little bug here, a little bug there in a couple of releases, I think back in the four eras, 4.1 or 4.2 or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>2010 is when I really got started in giving back, and, like, sharing my knowledge with the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:03:28]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is it important for you to attend WordCamps or contribute to the WordPress project?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Ricardas Kudirka </strong><strong>00:03:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is Ricardas Kudirka.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Basically, for everyone who&#8217;s using WordPress, it&#8217;s really important to understand how big the community is that we have here. So the community is an important and crucial part of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for it to grow, you need to attend the WordCamps, you need to share knowledge, and you need to meet people. So networking here and while meeting the exciting people who are developing WordPress or who are contributing to it, who are providing the services, who enable people to use WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a crucial point for everyone to attend.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Kathy Drewien </strong><strong>00:04:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s important to attend them because it&#8217;s very hard to describe them. We are not like any other thing you have ever done in your life. You have to be here to get it. And then once you get it, you wanna do more of it. It&#8217;s magical. It&#8217;s magical. There&#8217;s no way to get that experience without being here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of contributing, it&#8217;s a responsible thing to do. You want to give back instead of get, get, get. In the beginning, we&#8217;re all about the get, get, get. And then you go, oh my gosh. I didn&#8217;t know. I didn&#8217;t know I could do this. I didn&#8217;t know I had to write code. I can actually just stand around and talk to people and contribute to the project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Jen Miller </strong><strong>00:04:50]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, it&#8217;s a community effort, and so if we want it to progress and grow, we need to put our own individual effort into the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plus, we make friends, we make connections, and we find people who we can help and who can help us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:05:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I feel it is important to support the community that got me my start in technology and make sure that people understand that accessibility is very much a requirement.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, we need to make sure we keep the community inclusive for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:05:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>What is your favorite way to WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Patubo Kranzke </strong><strong>00:05:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I started with WordPress as a personal blogger. So it continues to be my favorite way to use WordPress. But, my use has evolved to using it for work as well as a place to share my photography and food blogging.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Courtney Robertson </strong><strong>00:05:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is through the Training team. Most of the things that I write these days are on make.wordpress.org/training and or learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love teaching people about WordPress, helping people at all skill levels advance, and that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll find me around the WordPress Training team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Dustin&nbsp; Hartzler </strong><strong>00:05:59]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My favorite way to WordPress is just building cool things. Like I have a website, my wife has a couple of websites, and me just trying to learn things and trying to do them myself. Yesterday, there was a session, a 15-minute long session, and I learned how to customize the options available for different core WordPress blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn&#8217;t realize that you could just make a button and like make a default like here&#8217;s the style for the default button. So every button&#8217;s exactly the same on the site. Like how cool is that? I like the side of customizing WordPress to make it easier for people who are non-techy like me to use my site, like my wife, and whatnot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:06:30]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do you use WordPress in your day-to-day life?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Topher </strong><strong>00:06:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s sort of a universal tool for me. I blog, and I do podcasts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I enjoy drinking whiskey, so I built a rating system for it. And I use it as a notepad, a scratch pad. I use it as my photography backup system. Just kind of as a universal tool for everything</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Alex Stine </strong><strong>00:06:53]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I currently am one of the Accessibility team reps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a core contributor, Guttenberg contributor, the occasional meta contributor, and the occasional training team contributor.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[</strong><strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong><strong>00:07:05]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, if that doesn&#8217;t convince you to go to a WordCamp or start your own meetup group, I just don&#8217;t know what will. Big thanks to everyone who sat down with us there in San Diego.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:23]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now it&#8217;s time for our small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First thing, WordPress Global Translation Day is coming up next week on September 28th. This is a great opportunity to learn more about the hard work that goes into translating all of this software for folks all around the world. If you want to learn more about how you could contribute to translations, I&#8217;ll have a link in the show notes for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that WooSesh is coming up on October 11th through 13th, 2022. This one is not an in-person event. It&#8217;s a WPSessions event, but it specifically talks about how to get some eCommerce going on your WordPress site. So if you&#8217;ve been thinking about how to get a shop on your site, or just making your current shop a bit more complicated, then this is the event for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third thing on our list today is All Things Open. They are hosting a hybrid event this year from October 31st through November 2nd. This event isn&#8217;t specific to WordPress, but it is specific to open source and one of the best resources for learning some OSS basics. So if you&#8217;ve been interested in learning more about how this whole open source thing is an idea that will change our generation, then set your sights on that event. I will have a link in the show notes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13481\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:15;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:64:\"Dropping security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/09/dropping-security-updates-for-wordpress-versions-3-7-through-4-0/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 07 Sep 2022 13:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Security\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"Updates\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13466\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:343:\"As of December 1, 2022 the WordPress Security Team will no longer provide security updates for WordPress versions 3.7 through 4.0.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:42]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping people who are new to WordPress learn how to make the most out of their CMS used to be one of the most clearly impactful things I ever did as a contributor. Whether it was making sure a brand new installation simply worked, or if the original setup needed to grow along with a solopreneur&#8217;s growing business needs, I found great joy in seeing how my local community was learning new tools together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You&#8217;ve probably heard me talk about the Learn WP initiative or the training team on this podcast before, but you might still be a little shy to get started with the team. So I have invited one of their team reps today to talk through what the team does.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I have with us today Hauwa Abashiya. She is one of the team reps for the training team and also works on the learn.wordpress.org site. Thank you for joining me today, Hauwa.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:01:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And thank you for having me, Josepha, quite exciting to be on your podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Oh, I, you know, when we were talking about doing this topic, I was like, you know, who would be an excellent person is Hauwa. Like you were such an interesting person to work with when we were working on the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/2020/12/simone/\">5.6 release</a>. And then also, you just have such a lovely way of explaining the complicated things that we have going on in WordPress and especially on the training side of things. And so you were the first person that came to mind for me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:02]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Speaking of all the learn.wordpress.org things, you&#8217;ve been contributing to the WordPress project as a team rep for the training team for a bit. But that&#8217;s not really where you started. Can you tell me a bit about how you found your way to this team?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:02:15]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, I started by attending a WordCamp, and that was WordCamp Brighton. And if anyone&#8217;s read my <a href=\"https://heropress.com/essays/finding-my-global-family/\">article on HeroPress</a>, then they will know that I learned WordPress in one week. Went through beginner sessions of it. And then, I was like, yeah, let me just go turn up and see what it&#8217;s like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So turned up, and I met some wonderful people there. One of them being <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/miss_jwo/\">Jenny Wong</a>, who introduced me to the London meetup team. So, I then went there. They were looking for volunteers because they were planning WordCamp London for 2019. And me being me, I was like, yeah, sure. Why not? And got thrown into the deep end, but no, an amazing team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I got to meet some really amazing people. And yeah, just went from there then, you know, because I was doing stuff with WordCamp London, ended up going to WordCamp Europe. And I think there&#8217;s probably quite a lot of people who say they fully got into contributing in WordCamp Europe. So I was doing little bits and pieces then on like, marketing team and then met <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jessecowens/\">Jesse [Owens]</a>  at the training team cause <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\">Abha Thakor</a> introduced me to him and just went from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in terms of team rep, I mean, <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/courane01/\">Courtney Robertson</a> sent out SOS, because Learn had just launched, and there were a couple of things that we needed. So that was during the soft launch. And I was like, yeah, sure. I&#8217;ll help you. I&#8217;m not doing much. And that&#8217;s how I ended up doing team rep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:46]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I love that so many initial stories in the WordPress community start with like, well, I went to a WordCamp cause I was like, what in the world is this? And then people were like, we need some help. And I thought to myself, what else am I doing? Like, so many stories start that way. And I just love it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:03]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you mentioned learn.wordpress.org. That is a part of the training team in the WordPress project. Correct?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So can you give us an idea of the difference between the two? Cause like normally, with a project as big as Learn, you would expect to see like a whole separate team. But these are two intertwined teams using two intertwined concepts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so can you give us an idea of the difference between them?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:04:29]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I like to see learners, that&#8217;s the content. So it&#8217;s the content that we have on the platform, and the training team wrangles all the content on Learn. So that would be like your videos, your lesson plans, and online workshops. Yeah, so we wrangle the content that&#8217;s on there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try to bring a lot of different teams together, and that&#8217;s one of the things the beauty, I think, of Learn is that there is a lot of cross-team collaboration, which started from the beginning and I think just will continue and get better and better.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:59]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. And the workshops, those are once a week, right?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:05:04]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So you have online workshops, which used to be called social learning spaces, which used to be called discussion groups. So those run once a week. There&#8217;s a number running, and there are some that are launching in Japan. And I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/bsanevans/\">Ben Evans</a> has been quite key in getting quite a lot of those going, and I think <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/piyopiyofox/\">Destiny Kanno</a> as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, that&#8217;s the beauty is you get to see a lot more languages coming up. Those run once a week. And then we obviously have lesson plans, which traditionally that&#8217;s what the training team used to always make for Meetup organizers. So if you didn&#8217;t have a speaker, you could go and get a lesson plan and run through something, or anybody could pick one up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they are used mainly by like our Meetup users and then people who are running any boot camps or sessions, or you wanna just take somebody through WordPress and teach them, you can pick one up and run through it. And now we&#8217;ve got courses on Learn, which is quite exciting. Got a couple of courses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I know there&#8217;s about three or four courses in development. There is a bit more WordPress development based rather than user based. There&#8217;s a fourth piece of content, and that is just the general workshop. So tutorials, I think no tutorials is what we&#8217;re calling them now. So there&#8217;s like all our online videos.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:17]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I tell you terminology in any project, the age and size of WordPress is hard to keep everything straight, but especially when you&#8217;ve just changed it you&#8217;re like, what do we call it though?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:27]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if I understand correctly, because as you mentioned, like you have this post up on HeroPress, you don&#8217;t actually come from a training background. Like you aren&#8217;t a teacher or corporate trainer or anything, but you have really committed to contributing to the training team and to learn.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, from your perspective, from like the, I&#8217;m not a trainer perspective, what&#8217;s the most exciting thing for learn.wordpress.org in the near future?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:06:58]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s the collaboration. It&#8217;s the potential that Learn has. So I don&#8217;t have a training background, but interestingly enough, I come from Kaduna, Nigeria. And Kaduna cause all the states in Nigeria have a tagline, and, Kaduna is actually the center of learning. So there must be some link there, so yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, I think the beauty of that is you don&#8217;t have to have a training background. You can come in and impart your knowledge, and there are people available in the team that can help you impart that knowledge. So if it&#8217;s like a lesson plan that you wanna draw up, we&#8217;ve got people that can help and assist in that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you wanna run an online workshop. There are people that can assist you. And I think that&#8217;s also the beauty of WordPress is that we&#8217;re all there to help each other. So just seeing that and seeing how, as time has gone on how the team has actually just been growing cause more and more people are coming.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with that, you&#8217;ve got more of like the different languages coming in, and I know we might touch on that later, but it&#8217;s, I think to me, that is the beauty that anyone can actually now come in and learn. And Learn as this platform that is accessible to everybody. So it&#8217;s not necessarily behind a, like a paywall or anything, which is, there&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, but there are people that it&#8217;s like, well, okay, you can access something by the community for the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:32]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think like your last thought there, something that&#8217;s by the community for the community. That&#8217;s one of the things that I noticed early on about the WordPress community. So I&#8217;ve been in the WordPress community for a long time, but when I started doing the administrative back office, things that are invisible and no one wants to know about, because it&#8217;s boring.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When I started doing that work, one of the things I noticed and that I really treasure the most about the WordPress community is that they want to do things together. They want to look at the problem together. They want to find a solution together. And a lot of times they just want to learn together as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We see that there is a real, I don&#8217;t know, not, it&#8217;s not a safety and numbers question. I think it is a long-standing feeling that we can all kind of get further together and that we are better together. And so I like your thought there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You mentioned, though, translations, and I know that this came up at WordCamp Europe.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We don&#8217;t actually have a lot of translated content on learn.wordpress.org. There&#8217;s some technical issues that exist there, but are there a few languages that we already are sort of seeing translated courses for? Translated lessons for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:09:47]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So we have a couple in Hindi, I believe. And I know we&#8217;ve got some Greek translations that have been coming up, so I know, I think it was last year WordCamp India, during contributor day, we had quite a lot of people translating stuff then, and I suppose the online WordCamps that we&#8217;ve been able to rank. Cause I think our first like face to face is this year, so they didn&#8217;t do that much translation there, but we&#8217;ve seen an increase in people wanting to translate.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think those are the ones that come to mind. And I know Japanese, I think that was just recently, in the last two weeks, somebody&#8217;s translated one or two of the tutorials have been translated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But we’re getting more and more requests coming through. And I know we kind of touched on this in our earlier discussion, but it&#8217;s like, how do you manage that? Cause you&#8217;re right, we don&#8217;t have a way to easily manage polyglots on Learn at the moment or WordPress in general. But I think seeing that, and I keep saying to people, I don&#8217;t wanna lose that engagement cause if you&#8217;ve got the people engaged, let them just do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t normally say this, but let them do it, and we&#8217;ll figure out how to sort out the whole pile when it comes in later. Because you kind of don&#8217;t want to lose them because I feel like if we say, no, we&#8217;ll wait until that comes in, we&#8217;ll lose a lot of the engagement. And come that time, people will be like, oh no, I&#8217;m not that interested. Or it might be an even more effort to try and bring more people on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:18]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s always a struggle, like wanting to be able to get something good out without insisting that it be perfect. Like that whole perfect is the enemy of the good sort of concept.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Mm-hmm&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When we were talking about this way back in June, I was like, I obviously would love to get a perfect solution out immediately, but like, you&#8217;re right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the meantime, do we just be if you don&#8217;t speak English, you cannot learn here?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like that&#8217;s not fair.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:45]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:46]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>We want everyone to be able to learn here in their own languages, and yeah. That&#8217;s just a living, breathing issue with a global project, I think.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:11:56]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that we left us on like a really juicy topic, just the lightest thing we could find. Is there anything else that you wanna be sure to share with the WordPress Briefing listeners before we head out?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:12:10]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Come and join the training team. Like I said, you don&#8217;t have to be a trainer. You can come in, and help us take notes. You can come in and edit, and review. If you are a subject matter expert, we also have the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/handbook/faculty-program/\">faculty program</a>, which was launched. Was it a month ago now?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sorry. Days, months, weeks merge for me these days. But yeah, so that&#8217;s like a dedicated volunteer team. And in there, we&#8217;ve got content creators, editors, subject matter experts, and just admin stuff. If you wanna help us with the admin stuff. If you&#8217;re a GitHub guru, get in touch cause we are trying to automate some of our processes, and we could use the help, but yeah, just come join us.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join one of our meetings, which run on Tuesdays at 7 AM UTC and 4:00 PM UTC.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, that&#8217;s right. I get my time right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If it&#8217;s not right, we&#8217;ll put it. We&#8217;ll correct it in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, if you are not necessarily familiar with the WordPress project and how to get started with contributions, you can find the training team and a lot of information about them and all the other teams on make.wordpress.org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will share that in the show notes as well. make.wordpress.org/training is where you can find Hauwa&#8217;s team. Hauwa, thank you again for joining me today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Hauwa Abashiya 00:13:30]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>No, thank you for having me. It&#8217;s just a wonderful treat. I get to listen to you, and now I get to be on it.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, yeah, it&#8217;s good.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:13:37]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that some of you feel inspired to stop by and see what the team is up to learn something new about WordPress or contribute a little something yourself. And with that, I&#8217;ll bring us home with the small list of big things. First thing, there was a freshly pressed minor release last week. You probably didn&#8217;t notice it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It probably went quite smoothly in the background and never interrupted you at all. However, if you want to read what was in it, you can head to wordpress.org/news now, or click on the link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Second thing, is that coming up at the end of this week, September 9th, 2022, WordCamp US is back and ready to help broaden your WordPress knowledge. If you will be there, I hope it is a wonderful time, but if you won&#8217;t be there in person, I&#8217;ll include a link to register for the live stream, or you can watch all of those sessions afterward on wp.tv or the WordPress YouTube channel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Third thing on our list of small list of big things is that WordPress Translation Day is coming up. That&#8217;s normally at the end of September, it coincides with a global day of appreciation for translators just generally across the world. And so that is coming, it&#8217;s normally around the 28th or so.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:14:55]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So put that in your calendars. As soon as I have any information, as soon as I have a link to share with you all, I will have that for you as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing on my list today is that if you are hoping to speak at WordCamp Asia, 2023, you have 10 more days, September 15th, 2022**, to apply for that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need topics of all sorts, from security hardening and backend development to entrepreneurial best practices, WordPress out of the box all the way back around to the importance of securing open source freedom. Even when people don&#8217;t know they need them. If you&#8217;ve got something you&#8217;re a bit passionate about, something that you are a passionate expert about especially, we want to see your application. And that, my friends, is your small list of big things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br>** <em><strong>Special note: the deadline to apply as a speaker to WordCamp Asia was extended to September 30th, 2022, after the recording of this episode.</strong></em></p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13425\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"People of WordPress: Bud Kraus\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:65:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/08/people-of-wordpress-bud-kraus/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 31 Aug 2022 21:30:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13385\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:135:\"The latest People of WordPress story features trainer Bud Kraus, from the United States, talking about the software and how he uses it.\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11:\"Abha Thakor\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:40:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/content/\";a:1:{s:7:\"encoded\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14109:\"\n<p><strong>This month, as we approach <a href=\"https://us.wordcamp.org/2022/\">WordCamp US</a>, we feature Bud Kraus, a WordPress trainer who has made a career in helping others learn about software.

He was determined not to let his sight difficulties stop him from his wish to  help others learn website building and maintenance skills.   </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As WordPress evolves and new features release, Bud decided to extend his training services around helping new and existing users improve and practice their skills. He supports others in open source through volunteering to speak at WordPress events, and encourages others to do so too. He also gives time to help produce material for the free-to-access resource <a href=\"https://learn.wordpress.org/\">Learn WordPress,</a> which is part of the WordPress.org project.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As a contributor to the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/\">Test</a> and <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/training/\">Training</a> teams, Bud is keen for others to try contributing to these areas and help support the project&#8217;s future development. One of his current training priorities is to help people with using the block editor and Full Site Editing. He is an advocate for the usability of WordPress today, saying: “I can design all aspects of a website now with a block.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Using WordPress as a traditional developer</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud’s WordPress journey began with a lunch at Grand Central Station in New York in 2009. A friend and former client was promoting the idea of using WordPress, which Bud initially resisted.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>“I’m a code guy…,” he told his friend at the time. “I will never use anything like that.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, the friend persisted. Eventually, Bud gave it a try and found a new approach with things called themes and plugins. His first encounter was with <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/download/releases/\">WordPress 2.6</a>. Bud signed up with a hosting company and found a theme where he could learn to edit and understand child themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said: &#8220;Once I saw that you could edit anything and make it yours, I was hooked. The endorphins were freely coursing through my veins.&#8221; Bud was hooked.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Teaching WordPress strengthens your own understanding of the software</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>There’s an old saying that the best way to learn something new is to turn around and teach someone else.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud was already an instructor at the Fashion Institute of Technology when he thought, “I could teach WordPress!”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he did, packing classrooms all through those first years of WordPress as it swept through the design world and further.<br><br>But Bud had more to discover. He said: &#8220;Two big things were about to happen that were really going to change my life. They would show me the way to the WordPress community – not that I even knew what that was.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Sharing lessons learnt with the WordPress community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2014, one of his students suggested he start going to the New York WordPress Meetup.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As he started going to WordCamps in New York City, he realized that WordPress was getting very large. What’s more, it had a community of people with whom he felt at home and could learn alongside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud gave a talk for the first time in 2016 at the only WordCamp to this day that has been held at the United Nations. He shared his knowledge of “Lessons Learned: Considerations For Teaching Your Clients WordPress.”&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"952\" height=\"1024\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=952%2C1024&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus talking at a WordCamp\" class=\"wp-image-13340\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?w=952&amp;ssl=1 952w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=279%2C300&amp;ssl=1 279w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/08/bud-kraus-1.jpg?resize=768%2C826&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 952px) 100vw, 952px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Bud Kraus speaks at WordCamps to help people use the software even more effectively</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>From there, Bud went on to speak at other WordCamps in the US. He also volunteered as a speaker wrangler for his home camp in New York City in 2018 and 2019.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>From speaking to writing about WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>At some point before the Covid-19 lockdown, Bud found another outlet, this time in writing.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud heard a magazine was advertising for submissions related to WordPress.&nbsp;His first attempted article did not make the cut.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So in his second submission, Bud took the risk of writing about something deeply personal – a topic he really didn’t want to write about at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He gathered his courage and revealed to the entire web design world that he was legally blind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The article appeared as&nbsp; <strong>“</strong><a href=\"https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/05/using-low-vision-teach-wordpress/\"><strong>Using Low Vision As My Tool To Help Me Teach WordPress</strong></a><strong>”.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"510\" height=\"600\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=510%2C600&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Bud Kraus\" class=\"wp-image-13426\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?w=510&amp;ssl=1 510w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/09/bud-kraus-2.jpg?resize=255%2C300&amp;ssl=1 255w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 510px) 100vw, 510px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\">Bud Kraus</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Since the age of 37, Bud has had macular degeneration in both eyes, which affects his central vision. It is a leading cause of legal blindness in the United States and many other countries.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He relies on his peripheral vision and finding ways to compensate. He also tends to see things in a flat dimension and has a difficulty discerning contrast&nbsp; &#8211; he&nbsp; is glad there are starting to be improvements in color contrasts in web design!<br><br>He uses tools like Speech to Text, larger sized cursors and bigger font sizes, and heavily uses zooming back in and out when working with WordPress. He is able to recognize patterns but has to rely on detailed preparation and memorizing materials.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In his first magazine article acknowledging this situation, he shared the added difficulties that technology creates for people with visual conditions, and tips that he had found to try and find alternative routes around them. He uses the technique of finding alternatives in his training work to help people learn and understand, realizing that all people have different ways of reading and understanding. His words and subsequent stories have inspired others and enabled more people to highlight accessibility. He describes himself as a ‘stakeholder in ensuring that the WordPress admin is accessible.’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A year after its first publication, the piece became a WordCamp talk, ‘My Way with WordPress.’ The talk was a hit and started many conversations about accessibility and the importance of raising awareness.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>A few months later, he gave a Gutenberg talk at the first WordCamp Montclair. There was no way he could have done it from a laptop, so instead, he did it from his 27” desktop computer. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Bud said: &#8220;It was a presentation on Gutenberg plugins. Since I couldn’t do this from a notebook screen (the screen is too small and the keyboard is hard for me to manipulate), it was decided that I would bring in my 27″ desktop machine to a WordCamp. I’m probably the first person to ever have done this. It was good thing I only lived a few miles away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He added: “I sat behind my computer, did my thing, and every once in a while peered out to make sure people were still there.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Different ways of contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the main ways Bud supported the community around the software was through talks at WordCamps and helping others to speak. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, he was keen to continue contributing when WordCamps were no longer meeting in person.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing: the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project, some insight into the community that supports it, and get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I’m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today is one of my favorite niche holidays &#8211; World Wide Web Day &#8211; which serves to raise awareness about the origins of the World Wide Web project. WordPress, as part of Web 2.0, only ever had a chance to exist because the web, as we have come to know it exists. So in order to mark this nerdy day on the WP Briefing, I invited a number of community members to share a bit about how WordPress has been a part of their lives.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But first, let&#8217;s do some introductions.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:01:07]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/awarner20/\">Adam Warner</a>, and I&#8217;m originally from a small town in west Michigan, now residing in Orlando, Florida.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:01:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\" data-type=\"URL\" data-id=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/aliceorru/\">Alice Orrù</a>. I&#8217;m Italian. I was born in the beautiful island of Sardinia, but I&#8217;ve been living in Spain in the province of Barcelona for 10 years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal 00:01:26]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/thewebprincess/\">Dee Teal</a>; Dee is short for Denise. I&#8217;m from New Zealand, but I live In Melbourne.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:01:33]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah, my name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/femkreations/\">Femy Praseeth</a>. I was born and raised in India and now live in San Jose, California, with my family and cuddly Doodle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:01:41]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/jillbinder/\">Jill Binder</a>, and I&#8217;ve just moved back to Vancouver, Canada.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:01:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/users/mariaojob/\">Mary Job</a>. I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2015, and I&#8217;m from Nigeria. I&#8217;m from the Western part of Nigeria. Ijebu precisely.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:01:57]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/onealtr/\">Oneal Rosero</a>. I am from the Philippines and I&#8217;ve been using WordPress since 2007.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe</strong> <strong>00:02:06]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you. My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamsirotee/\">Theophilus Adegbohungbe</a> . And I&#8217;m from Ilesa, Osun State in Nigeria.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:02:14]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My name is <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/ugyensupport/\">Ugyen Dorji</a> and I&#8217;m from Bhutan. And I&#8217;m working with WordPress for more than five years.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:22]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I enjoy the most about being part of any community is being able to see how people change and grow over time as they learn and gain confidence in their own expertise. So a favorite early question is naturally, ‘How has WordPress changed your World?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:02:37]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress changed my world in many ways. But, uh, starting from the moment, it allowed me to become part of a global connected and welcome community. I started using WordPress as a blogger many, many years ago, but it was in 2015 that I started working behind the scenes of WordPress with a plugin company.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was the moment when everything changed, basically, because I realized that WordPress was much more than a CMS for creating websites. It was a world full of opportunities for networking, making new friends and walking a new professional path as well.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:03:15]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>During one interview, I was asked many questions about WordPress and although I had a basic understanding of WordPress, I struggled to give detailed answers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After that interview, I resolved to develop my skills and learn as much about WordPress as possible. A few months passed and I received a call from ServeMask In, [who] had developed a plugin called All-in-One WP Migration plugin. They offered me a position which fulfilled my wish to work with WordPress full time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because of that, I am now an active contributor to the WordPress community as bread and butter, with the best career in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:04:03]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are very familiar with my country, Nigeria things here, it&#8217;s not as smooth as it is in other parts of the world. That is, when you are done in school in my university, you have to find means of surviving yourself.&nbsp; There is nothing like the government have work for you. There is nothing like you finish our institution and you get job instantly. So it&#8217;s very tough here. And, year by year, schools keep producing graduates with no companies to employ them and no government job again as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I personally, I was able to gain freedom from this with the help of WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Femy Praseeth 00:04:51]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress completely changed my work life. I started working independently. I started freelancing with agencies and designers and, uh, building websites from their web designs. And this was around the time my son was born. Actually, he was in elementary school and I think this was around 2014 or so. I started working remotely when remote was not even a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there were very few companies that let you work from home and remote was not a mainstream thing at all, but with WordPress, I could set my own working hours while my son was in school.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:29]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>And of course, my preferred follow-up question of, ‘How did you hear about us?’ or ‘How did you connect to this global community?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:05:36]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes, actually what I love about WordPress is that it&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s not a business. It&#8217;s not a company. It&#8217;s a community. It&#8217;s a community that&#8217;s always ready to help support, teach and encourage people. That&#8217;s how I felt when I joined the community. There&#8217;s always somebody who has your back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s always somebody who&#8217;s going to guide you. There&#8217;s always an expert who will take your hand and lead you into the beauty that is WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:06:05]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The way that I connect with the global community these days are one, of course, is .org Slack. Another of course is Twitter as there&#8217;s a very active WordPress community there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with WordCamps all over the globe. I&#8217;m lucky enough to have been able to travel to several hundred WordCamps through the years in the US and abroad. And that&#8217;s one of the most rewarding parts is meeting people from all over the world and you see really how small and the world really is and how similar we really all are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Theophilus Adegbohungbe 00:06:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, not until 2020. I don’t know if you know this lady, a very vibrant lady in WordPress. She&#8217;s from Nigeria; her name is Mary Job, and she&#8217;s really promoting WordPress here. So it was through her that I got to know about the community. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:06:54]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>My work is the global WordPress community. So we hold our three programs for the global WordPress community, and we are always trying to reach more and more countries. For quite a while, it was very North America-heavy, and then I made some efforts to expand. And it&#8217;s very exciting that this year, some contributors in our team have actually launched an Asia Pacific branch of our group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we have two meetings every other week where we have the America/Europe and the APAC, and we&#8217;ve also been able to reach other countries as well, but we typically reach something like between 20 and 50 countries a year, depending on the year. So a hundred percent global. Yes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:39]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>How has WordPress, either the CMS or the project, made you feel more connected? And are there any surprising connections that came from WordPress?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Teal&nbsp; 00:07:47]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I guess the surprising connections I think that have come from WordPress have been the fact that I feel like I&#8217;ve got friends all over the world. And a lot of those have come out of community involvement and from contributing. That I could go to a, a meetup pretty much anywhere in the world and probably find somebody I know, or at least a second degree connection of somebody that I haven&#8217;t, you know, that I might not have met, but know somebody that I know. And certainly that happens fairly regularly.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Mary Job 00:08:13]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress. The WordPress project, the community, has made me feel connected in a huge way, because I am literally surrounded by everything WordPress. So I like how, when you meet somebody who does WordPress, there&#8217;s this instant, ‘Oh, we&#8217;re brothers,’ or&nbsp; ‘Oh, we&#8217;re sisters!’ You know? There&#8217;s that feeling? That&#8217;s how I feel.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when I see somebody who does WordPress, as I do, I&#8217;m like, ‘Oh yeah, we&#8217;re, kin.’ You know? We are family. That&#8217;s how I feel when I meet people who do WordPress. And I&#8217;ve met quite a number of people who do WordPress from like around the world. Like I have a friend here, he&#8217;s from the Benin Republic, and we host started a dinner on Friday night and one of my guests was asking me, ‘How did you guys meet?’</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, ‘Oh yeah, we work in the same WordPress ecosystem.’ He attended our WordCamp, we became friends, and we just literally became really good friends. So I have tons of people that I&#8217;ve met like that I hold in high esteem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Ugyen Dorji 00:09:12]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress Meetups are the seeds that lead to the growth of WordPress communities. WordCamp is a platform for plugin and theme developers to meet WordPress users and website developers. It&#8217;s a great environment where many incredible discussions about WordPress takes place. With each WordCamp there is a &#8220;tribe&#8221; meeting, where I think people [can] get more connected. It&#8217;s a fantastic opportunity for aspiring computer engineers, generators and get to showcase their talent and meet each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Alice Orrù 00:09:51]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the project level, it has given me the opportunity to feel like an active part of a global project. The idea that I can give my contribution to making the web a better place &#8211; it’s amazing. And I do so with the Translation team, so making WordPress accessible to all the people that use the core plugins and themes in Italian, and prefer to do that in Italian.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:18]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What area of the WordPress world is most important to you?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Jill Binder 00:10:21]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have a little bit of a passion for diversity in tech and diversity in WordPress, specifically around events. And so, here&#8217;s a chance to name the three programs that we&#8217;ve been working on this year. So as mentioned a few times, we have our <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/meetup-organizer/event-formats/diversity-speaker-training-workshop/\">Diverse Speaker Workshop</a> that helps people go from not even having the thought that people could step up on stage.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second program is because of the pandemic. There was no longer the straight path from taking our workshop to speaking, because we used to hold them or people used to hold them for their WordCamps and meetups. And so it was like, okay, you&#8217;ve taken. Apply for our next WordCamp or meetup. But during the pandemic, that wasn&#8217;t a thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have this amazing channel that we welcome everyone to join, allies and people from underrepresented groups who are interested in speaking or interested in supporting people and speaking. And that&#8217;s the Diverse Speaker channel <a href=\"https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/C028SE81N3H\">diverse-speaker-support</a> channel on the Make WordPress slack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third program is, and we, we went through a name change recently. So I&#8217;ll try to remember the new change it&#8217;s Organizing Inclusive and Diverse WordPress Events. And this is for WordCamp and meetup organizers to learn. We&#8217;ve learned over the last couple years, how important it is to create inclusive spaces and be good allies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But how do we actually do that? And a few of us created a very action oriented workshop in 2019 for WCUS, and that is now the basis of the work that we are bringing to people and people are loving it.. We&#8217;ve had people report a 40%, self-report 40%, increase in feeling prepared to create an inclusive event from before and after taking that workshop, which is super cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So, that’s my passion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Oneal Rosero 00:12:13]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I really love helping the WP Diversity team. I love running the workshops. I love running the workshops for myself, because I used to do training for software back before the pandemic. I used to train up to a thousand people a year in person, sometimes like 500 people in a room at once.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But of course I had to shift. I had to pivot to online training, which is what the training team has brought for me. And the focus on the diversity. I like running the workshops. I like running workshops for different groups, different countries, because it&#8217;s nice to meet new people. It&#8217;s nice to hear about their culture, about the limitations that people have in Africa with connectivity.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So they, they resort to using WhatsApp on their phone in order to do a meetup. That&#8217;s how they do their, their meetings, their discussions. It&#8217;s unlike other countries where we can do video calls. They have to use their mobile phones because connectivity isn&#8217;t accessible.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Places like in the Philippines that get affected when it starts to rain a little bit, we lose our internet. So we have backups and our backups have backups. So there are many things that you learn that are different when you&#8217;re living in the city, when you&#8217;re living in the provinces, in the country. So it&#8217;s so many things that you learn about people and how they&#8217;re able to adapt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Adam Warner 00:13:35]</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Enabling end users to reach their goals. And whether that means participating in contributing to the software, to the Core software itself, in terms of UI/UX usability. That can include participating in the community and sharing your knowledge proactively with users who may be new to the platform, or have used WordPress for a while, but now want to step up their game, get a little deeper into using their websites as a tool for growth, for whatever business that they&#8217;re in. So, I mean, overall, the, the most important part of the WordPress world to me are the end users. And, you know, there, there is this quote unquote inner circle of WordPress community people. People who are involved in .org, people who contribute to the software, people who contribute to the 20 plus make.wordpress.org teams.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those we have to keep in mind, are not the average user by and far. They are not the typical user that hears the word WordPress and then goes out and searches it and then has to figure out how to use it. So I think user experience is probably the most important part for me and making sure that any of that innate knowledge that we have in that inner circle of WordPress because many of us have been using it for so long, keeping in mind that is not the norm. And it&#8217;s not the scale at which WordPress is used and, and making sure we translate complex concepts down to a layperson&#8217;s terms that might not be as familiar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:15:17]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things that I have always found so fascinating about the web and WordPress’ role in it is how it has made the world simultaneously smaller and bigger. By giving voices to the voiceless we help each other find our community niches regardless of where they are in the world. Some of your closest friends could be people you would never meet in your own neighborhood. Well, let’s hear what some of our community members had to say about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Dee Tea 00:15:42]</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the thing that has been most empowering is, is coming into the project either in terms of contributing time and efforts to the community, which is where most of my contribution has been &#8211; has always been about this is a really cool thing, and I really want to build this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I&#8217;ll put my time and efforts into building WordPress. Not for me, but because I see its value and I see its community and I see that the contribution that it&#8217;s making to the world and I, and that&#8217;s really important. But finding that on the other side of that was a huge amount of personal benefit for me in my career, in the friendships that I&#8217;ve made.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I feel like if I had been approaching the community with, I want a better career, I wanna meet all of these people and I want, and I want all of this. From, “I want” for me, instead of, I want for this project, for the community and effectively for the world with that, you know, that whole democratized, the democratizing of publishing is this thing that serves the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s been the key for me is that I absolutely have reaped amazing benefits from it, but it came out of that sense of, I see this value here and I want to contribute to that because it&#8217;s gonna have value, not just for me, but for a whole slew of people. And so, uh, you know, for much, much bigger impact than just on me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I think that&#8217;s the important thing for me is that sense of, if you approach it with that attitude of what can I do to help? It&#8217;s amazing what you will find yourself helped with in return.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:17:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I hope that you enjoyed this tour of WordPress in the World Wide Web. I want to share a big thank you to all of the folks who contributed to our little WordPress Briefing celebration of World Wide Web Day today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. So firstly, we&#8217;ve got a couple of updates from our upcoming flagship events. WordCamp US has announced a speaker support fund specifically for historically underrepresented speakers at the event. You can donate to the fund on the page if you&#8217;d like, and there are also directions on how to request support, if you are part of an underrepresented group.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From the folks over at WordCamp Asia, the call for speakers is live. That&#8217;s taking place in February, 2023. But it&#8217;s never too early to brush up those presentations and get them submitted.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Next big thing is that there are some changes coming to the WordPress mobile app. A lot of the Jetpack functionality will be removed from it, so this is going to have a little bit of an effect on daily users of the app, but it will also have an effect on regular contributors. I&#8217;ll have a link to the full write up in the show notes so that you don&#8217;t have to guess or hold it all in your memory.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And finally, this excellent design that you see on wordpress.org/news is finally making its way out to the next parts of the wordpress.org website. Before you know, it, there will be a fresh looking homepage as well as few other pages and then… to infinity and beyond (or something like that).&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that, my friends, is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And next up I&#8217;ll be taking just a mid-year break from the podcast. And so the next time that I actually see you again, will be in September.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13198\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:23;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:72:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"People of WordPress: Carla Doria\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/people-of-wordpress-carla-doria/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sun, 31 Jul 2022 19:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:6:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"Community\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"Features\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:2;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:7:\"General\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:3;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Interviews\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:4;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"HeroPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:5;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:19:\"People of WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13201\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:324:\"In this series, we share some of the inspiring stories of how WordPress and its global network of contributors can change people’s lives for the better.

This month we feature Carla Doria, a customer support specialist from South America on how WordPress opened up a new world for her, and gave her the ability to help the local community</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For Carla, working with WordPress is a vital part of her life. It gave her a career and a community, in which she she would organize the first WordCamp in her city, Cochabamba, and the first in Bolivia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla studied industrial engineering and has a master’s degree in environmental studies.<br>Her first experience with WordPress was when she decided to start a small business designing and selling cushions and bedclothes.&nbsp;While Carla sat in the small store she had rented, hoping that people stopping at the shop windows would step in to buy something, she decided she needed to create a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>First steps with WordPress</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla had no budget to hire somebody, but she felt confident&nbsp; she could learn things on her own.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“Learning to use WordPress requires no code skills or a technical background. It needs an adventurous and playful spirit.” </p><cite>Carla Doria</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>She had always been studious, and decided she would figure out how to build a website herself. Carla ended up building a simple blog with WordPress. At the time, she didn’t even have a budget to buy a custom domain, so she used a free subdomain.<br><br>“Learning to use WordPress is easy. It requires no code skills or a technical background at all. It only needs an adventurous and playful spirit,” said Carla</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There were no profits, and any income mainly went to pay the store’s rent. At the time, her previous company contacted her for a job opening that matched her profile. Carla needed that income and decided to closed the store and forget about being an entrepreneur.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Back in employee mode, Carla started her new job as a technical writer for a software development company. Since Carla had completed her master’s degree in the UK, she was proficient in English. Her close affinity for computers and technology made it easy for her to translate complex software jargon into simple tutorial steps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Carla got more interested in technical writing and started to improve her writing skills. This reconnected her with her previous enthusiasm for writing, and she decided to channel that interest into a blog.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Diving deep</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Creating her blog helped her become more familiar with WordPress and building websites. In 2015, Carla blogged about writing, her thoughts, book reviews, and everything that came to mind.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Through looking for answers to specific issues using her WordPress blog, Carla found the support forums a useful place to go. Soon she realized that she could also help answer other people’s questions.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13189\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-2.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla began checking the forums as a hobby. She liked that she was able to help people and learn more while doing so. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Instead of surfing social media during her work breaks, Carla focused on checking the WordPress forums. Through this she learnt about a support job in one of the global firms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She felt the job was made for her and was excited to support people in building their websites with WordPress. The role offered the possibility to work remotely and travel while still working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After three years as a technical writer, her career felt stuck. She was certain she did not want to return to any job related to industrial engineering. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla did not get through the selection process the first time. But after nearly 18 months between three applications and learning HTML and CSS, Carla finally secured a support job in 2016. With this job, WordPress became her main source of income.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Leading a local WordPress community</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the job, Carla learned about the WordPress communities around the world and WordCamps. But when somebody asked about the WordPress community where Carla lived, she didn’t know what to say. Was there a community?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She discovered no local group existed, so she researched what was needed to setup a meetup. Carla discussed the idea with others, but hesitated as she thought it would require an expert WordPress developer to organize.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But after trying to gauge interest, Carla realized that the only way to find community members was to start a community. In 2017, the <a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/Cochabamba-WordPress-Meetup/\">WordPress community in Cochabamba</a> was born.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"684\" height=\"391\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=684%2C391&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"The theme preview screen in the WordPress Cochabamba meeting on creating your website with blocks.\" class=\"wp-image-13236\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?w=684&amp;ssl=1 684w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/Comunidad_WP_Cochabamba_FSE_event2022.jpg?resize=300%2C171&amp;ssl=1 300w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 684px) 100vw, 684px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>WordPress meeting in Cochabamba explored creating your website with blocks</em></figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The group has had ups and downs, probably similar to any other community. Although Cochabamba is not a big city, they had issues finding a location that was free and available to anyone who wanted to join. People came with different levels of knowledge, from people with&nbsp;vast experience with WordPress to people with no experience but who wanted to learn.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The community grew during the pandemic, as meetups went online and people from other cities in Bolivia were able to attend. After restrictions were lifted, there was a lot of excitement amongst members to meet each other in person.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Giving back through speaking</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"600\" height=\"900\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=600%2C900&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Carla reading a book under a tree\" class=\"wp-image-13191\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?w=600&amp;ssl=1 600w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/carla-doria-1.jpg?resize=200%2C300&amp;ssl=1 200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The community also helped Carla to develop a new skill in public speaking. She applied to be a speaker at WordCamp Mexico <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2019/\">2019</a> and <a href=\"https://mexicocity.wordcamp.org/2020/\">2020</a>, <a href=\"https://guayaquil.wordcamp.org/2019/\">WordCamp Guayaquil 2019</a>, and <a href=\"https://colombia.wordcamp.org/2020/\">WordCamp Colombia in 2020</a>. Her confidence grew while she enjoyed connecting with other communities and meeting people who were on similar pathways. Not all of them were developers, as she had presumed. Many, like her, started out as bloggers.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"977\" height=\"419\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=977%2C419&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"WordCamp Cochabamba\'s logo with blue and grey lettering and a hat\" class=\"wp-image-13228\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?w=977&amp;ssl=1 977w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=300%2C129&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/07/WCC.png?resize=768%2C329&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 977px) 100vw, 977px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Finally, after three years, Carla applied to organize her first WordCamp in 2021 in <a href=\"https://cochabamba.wordcamp.org/2021/\">Cochabamba</a>. She had never imagined organizing any WordCamp, and through this having the experience to talk to sponsors and contact companies, and lead a group of people with different talents and backgrounds. Carla felt she had learnt so much from the experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to WordPress, Carla found a job she enjoyed, was able to work remotely, and help build something in her community to help people learn skills and find career opportunities.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Carla feels grateful for all she has been able to do thanks to WordPress. She said: “WordPress has led me to find good jobs.

The podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is an open source software project and, like many other open source software projects, has an entire community of people who show up to help improve it however they can. Most of you probably use WordPress every day in some way. And I&#8217;m going to assume that since you listen to this podcast, you&#8217;re also interested in how this all works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the things I mention practically every episode is that WordPress works and continues to work because of generous contributions from people all around the world. I consider my work with WordPress to be my way of giving back for everything that this software enabled me and my family to do. But I once was a first-time contributor, and I remember what it felt like before I knew everything.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I felt like it moved at the speed of light and that I could never tell what to do now, let alone what to do next. And that everyone around me basically already knew everything. And if you are feeling that way right now, I encourage you to take a big deep breath [breathe] and let me help you get started.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:43]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m a roadmap sort of person. So I&#8217;m going to start by sharing the stages I&#8217;ve observed for folks who are contributing to open source. That way, you can tell where you are right now, which spoiler alert is probably a bit further along than you realize. Then I&#8217;ll give you some questions you can ask yourself for each stage to figure out what is a good fit for you. Think of it as a guided exploration.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, the five stages. So these are they:&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<ol><li><strong>Connecting</strong>. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first learning about the community. You know WordPress exists, but now you&#8217;ve just discovered that the community exists. That&#8217;s where you are.&nbsp;</li><li>The second phase is <strong>Understanding</strong>. It&#8217;s when you are researching the community, like, you know it exists, you think you want to give back, and so you&#8217;re trying to figure out where everything is.&nbsp;</li><li>The third phase is what I call <strong>Engaging</strong>. It&#8217;s when you&#8217;re first interacting, you&#8217;ve downloaded the CMS, you have figured out which team you think you&#8217;re interested in, and you&#8217;re headed to events or meetings or whatever.&nbsp;</li><li>The fourth stage is one that I refer to as <strong>Performing</strong>. And that&#8217;s when you&#8217;ve decided that you&#8217;re gonna volunteer and you&#8217;re gonna take some action. You&#8217;re going to like a contributor day or running a release or whatever. I think that&#8217;s probably not the first place you land, running a release is probably a lot, but, you know, coordinating work on the release or something like that.&nbsp;</li><li>And then phase five, which is the <strong>Leading</strong> phase. That&#8217;s when you&#8217;re taking responsibility for things getting done.&nbsp;</li></ol>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:08]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we get any further, there are four important things to remember about those stages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The first thing to remember is that there is no set time between any of those stages. You can start in one and then three years later go to the next one, or you can start in one and go into the next stage tomorrow. The next thing to know is that each stage builds on the one before it. In my observation, anytime I have seen a contributor who feels like they&#8217;re really struggling, it&#8217;s because they skipped a stage in there, which really causes some trouble for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The next thing to remember is that not everyone will make it through these stages, which is okay. The majority of the community stops at three. Most contributors stop at four. And that is perfectly fine. That is expected. That is normal and completely in line with what we expect from contribution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, and the final thing to remember about that list of the phases is that very few people make it into that leadership stage. If we assume, like I do, that 1% of the people who are using WordPress also show up and contribute back to WordPress, then it&#8217;s kind of safe to assume also that about 1% of those people who have shown up to contribute to WordPress are moving into a space where they feel like they&#8217;re willing to take responsibility for making sure things get done in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:31]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like we all collectively feel responsible for WordPress&#8217;s success, but in that leadership area, you&#8217;re kind of taking responsibility for 40% of the web or whatever&#8217;s going on there. And not a lot of people make it there, and that is completely fine, too. So that&#8217;s our basic terminology today. Those are the caveats that go with our basic terminology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most difficulties that arise for new contributors happen because a stage got skipped somewhere along the way. It&#8217;s almost never intentional, but from what I&#8217;ve observed, that&#8217;s what makes it really difficult to get started and what makes it difficult to keep going once you&#8217;ve kind of already gotten in there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, all right. Big breath, folks with me again [breathe]. Alright, it&#8217;s guided exploration time.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First phase, the connecting phase. Remember, this is where you&#8217;ve just learned the community exists, people are talking about it, you don&#8217;t know much more. The first step for you is asking yourself what it is you could do. Or if there&#8217;s a project out there that looks particularly interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:36]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can ask yourself questions, like, am I a writer? And if I am a writer, do I write technical or prose. The other thing you can ask is, am I a PHP developer, a JavaScript developer, Python, Go; which language am I writing in because I find it most beautiful. Another thing you can ask yourself is, am I a teacher or a mentor, or do I just generally like to be a mighty helper? And I like to make sure that things keep running.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So once you&#8217;ve asked yourself those things, it&#8217;s on to phase two, the understanding phase. This is when you&#8217;re looking around at this new-to-you community to see what is happening where. So you take a look at the teams that are around, you think about whatever it was you said you were good at in the last question and you look at which teams might be a good fit.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you said that you&#8217;re a good technical writer, then Docs probably is for you. Have you been training others to use WordPress for years? Then you might wanna look into Training. There are a lot of other things, obviously, like if you think you&#8217;re good at working with code PHP or JavaScript, you&#8217;re probably gonna end up in Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you are particularly good at any of the other tech stacks that we have around in our Trac area or an Openverse, then that&#8217;s where you&#8217;ll land over there. You have design options. Like if design is really your thing, we have a Design team, but we also have a Themes team. There are plenty of places that you can land depending on what it is that you feel like you are the best at and could really help the WordPress project. And so that&#8217;s your phase two.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that you have gotten a good guess at a team, we&#8217;re gonna swing through to phase three, which is the engaging phase. This is the phase that is the scariest for most people, but it&#8217;s okay. I am here for you. I am here for you in this podcast. So you have figured out what you want to do in order to contribute, and you&#8217;ve got a sense for the team that looks right. There are two things that you do next.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:34]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One is that you can go to a meeting. There are many kinds of meetings. There are team meetings, bug scrubs, and testing sessions, but they&#8217;re all in Slack, which means that you can attend one from anywhere. When they kick off, you wave, you introduce yourself, you let everybody know that you&#8217;re there and you&#8217;re observing. Folks will welcome you and just kind of give you some concept of what they&#8217;re working on. Easy as that. You&#8217;ve done your first time meeting attendance.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another good option is to keep an eye out for specific events. Some of those events happen online, like Global Translation Day. But also some of them happen in person like, Meetups or WordCamps. And there again, you show up, you wave, you introduce yourself, see if you can make a connection or two, let people know that you&#8217;re new and you&#8217;re just trying to figure out where you are and what you wanna do.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;ve made it now, all the way to phase four, the performing phase, then give yourself a little pat on the back! Figuring out where you want to go and who your friendly faces are is the biggest challenge when you get started. So congratulations!&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:08:37]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Phase four is the phase where you&#8217;ve decided you&#8217;re brave enough to volunteer &#8211; to do some contribution. You&#8217;re volunteering your time. That&#8217;s where you are now. So oddly enough, you start this phase by assigning yourself something, assigning yourself, a task. This seems counterintuitive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s this feeling that you can&#8217;t say that you&#8217;re gonna do something. That you can&#8217;t just assign something to yourself and say that you&#8217;re gonna do it. But in open source projects, you always can. You find a task where you&#8217;re comfortable, and you just mention that you would like to give it a try while the team is having their weekly meeting. And it&#8217;s simple as that. And not big things either. Like organizing an event or maintaining a component, those are probably too big for your first time around.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m talking things like, &#8216;I will test that patch that you mentioned in the meeting.&#8217; Or &#8216;I will review the docs and make sure that they&#8217;re up to date with the most recent release.&#8217; Or &#8216;I can help run meetings for the next release.&#8217;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you have phase five, where you just repeat phase four until you are leading something! And I don&#8217;t mean leading in the 1950s sort of way, where you have like a corner office and you&#8217;re ordering people around. I mean, in the warm, inviting millennial way where you&#8217;re leading by inspiring people to do something or you&#8217;re leading because you make sure that the meeting happens every single week.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or you&#8217;re leading because you added screenshots to tickets that needed testing and so you moved something forward in a way that was helpful. Easy peasy. You can go to your first contributor today or a WordPress Slack meeting and just be a contributor by the time you leave, right? You might feel like ‘easy as that isn&#8217;t quite the right set of words right there. And as a matter of fact, you might be thinking to yourself, this woman is just plain wrong. It could not possibly be that easy. And I agree. It really isn&#8217;t literally quote-unquote just that easy. Just like handing someone a notebook and a pen will not instantly make them an award-winning novelist, handing someone a wordpress.org profile and credentials to Slack won&#8217;t instantly make them a contributor.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For both of those examples, what makes someone good is the ability to try and fail and still be encouraged to try again. So if it&#8217;s been a while since you contributed and you&#8217;re thinking about returning, or if you&#8217;ve been listening to me for a while and you&#8217;re ready to give this contribution thing a try, I hope this helps you to feel brave enough to try and brave enough to fail.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I encourage you to be brave enough to try again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:11:20]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at our small list of big things. My friends, we have a Performance team. This team has been a working group for a long time and is focused on some deep, inner workings of WordPress and its surrounding ecosystem to make sure that we are as fast and slick as possible. You can check them out on make.wordpress.org/performance, their brand new site, and see when they&#8217;re meeting, what they&#8217;re aiming to get into the WordPress 6.1 release, and if that&#8217;s something that you would like to contribute to.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second thing is that there&#8217;s a brand new call out for testing. This time it&#8217;s focused on templates and retroactively applying them to an entire category of posts. So it&#8217;s a little bit workflow testing, a little bit technology testing, and we could really use your help in bug hunting for both of those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the final thing is that you know since contribution is obviously the focus of today&#8217;s podcast, we are looking for table leads for WordCamp US’ contributor day that&#8217;s coming up in September. There&#8217;s a whole blog post about it, I&#8217;ll link to it in the show notes so that you&#8217;ll have all the info and can raise your hand if you want.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:12:25]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of things that I&#8217;ll have in the show notes, I also am going to put like a contributor quizlet guide thing. If the guided, figuring out of the teams in the phase two section, if that didn&#8217;t make any sense to you and you just need something to direct you specifically to potential teams, I&#8217;m gonna link to the contributor kind of sorting hat quiz that came out with WordCamp Europe.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:40]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today I&#8217;m talking about Five for the Future– again. Before we get stuck right into the heart of it, 10 episodes ago, in episode 25, I focused on the Five for the Future initiative and I recommend that you listen to that before you join me in today&#8217;s episode. It&#8217;s only eight minutes and it gives you a history of the Five for the Future initiative, as well as some information on the Five for the Future program.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It then goes on to talk about some of the original intentions behind that original initiative. The reason I bring this back up today is partially because one, I will talk about both the program and the initiative it&#8217;s based on literally anytime. I believe strongly that they are both a vital part of what will result in a triumph of the commons of WordPress, and keep this empowering project around for years to come.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I also bring it up today because there&#8217;s conversation about a post I published a couple of months back that has generated some dialogue around the intentions of this catchy call to contribution. So to make sure that as we move through this discussion together, we are working with as much factual information as possible, I present to you some facts.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:46]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First and foremost, the pillars of this initiative. The 5% in Five for the Future is aspirational. Contribution to open source is a question and indication of privilege. So the 5% is not a requirement, but rather it&#8217;s an aim. It could refer to 5% of your time or 5% of your resources, or just any amount of your time or resources around. Regardless of how you&#8217;re defining it, it is an aspiration, not a requirement.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second pillar, pledges show your intention and whatever contributions you are able to offer after you&#8217;ve made your pledge are always welcome. No one is out there checking for 100% completion of the hours that you intended to give back to WordPress versus the hours that you actually succeeded at giving back to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are so many volunteers that make sure that this project is running and functional and has plenty of people knowing how to get things done and how to teach others how to get things done. It&#8217;s all coming from generosity of heart.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:52]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And speaking of generosity, the third thing that is important about this initiative is that it insists on and wants to celebrate a culture of generosity. Beyond the concept of a pledge, is the idea of generous collaboration toward the long term health and stability of our project for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As contributors, we understand that we are greater than the sum of our parts and what we build <em>within</em> WordPress empowers those who build <em>with</em> WordPress. So those are the pillars that went into that initial thought, that opening Five for the Future call to action that Matt gave to everybody in 2014.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so now I want to share with you some of the pillars of the program that has grown up around it. So the Five for the Future initiative, if you&#8217;re not familiar, was started in 2014 and is a grand call to all of us to remember to give back to the shared commons of WordPress. Its aim was to help guard against what is called the “tragedy of the commons,” where resources are continually taken out and not necessarily reinvested in. No one&#8217;s necessarily putting anything back into those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:06]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the starting point for all of this. So the program, the Five for the Future program, in 2018 was built as a collaborative effort with full participation and buy-in from the contributors who were active in the project at the time. It allowed anyone to raise their hands, to show support of WordPress via a pledge and also started a multi-year discussion of how to define contributions in a way that let us automatically provide props and therefore more effectively put badges on people&#8217;s wordpress.org profiles.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then in 2019, there was an additional pilot of the program, which kind of offered some team structure, which was intended to not only take on work that I don&#8217;t like to ask volunteers to do, but also to provide some checks and balances to an absolute raft of sponsored contributor hours that we had started to see show up.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which brings us then to the post that I mentioned at the start. Knowledgeable supporters of the WordPress open source project have debated next iterations to Five for the Future activity and programming. So, to bring the conversation to a central set of questions, or rather to bring the conversation to a central spot, I raised these two questions. One, what activities can we see inside our contributor networks? So wordpress.org, make.wordpress.org, the Rosetta sites that we have, Slack, et cetera.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So what activities can we see inside the contributor networks that we can flag to enable easier distribution of props and therefore badges? The second question is, what activities can we see also in those contributor networks that appear to be contributions, but in the end are only benefiting the person or company that provides the contributions?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For what it&#8217;s worth that discussion then also raised a third question that I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ve even started to tackle, which is what about the activities that are not in the contributor network, but still do move WordPress forward? Cause there are so, so many of those things and it&#8217;s a great question. I don&#8217;t have an answer and just so that I don&#8217;t leave you all with a series of questions for which there are no answers provided in this particular podcast, I do have a few answers for questions that I have seen floating around this discussion.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first question is actually a bunch of questions. There are like three parts to it. What are props, who gives props, and who tracks them? So ‘props’ is a term used in WordPress to describe shared recognition of a contribution. Think of it as like a hat tip or kudos or an assist. However you think about it, it&#8217;s recognition of the other people who helped to solve a problem along the way. That is what props are.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:47]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The second part of that question is who gives props and historically developers have given props, which tends to mean that it&#8217;s mostly developers who get props. But now, also, any team rep during a release cycle can provide props to folks on their team, volunteers on their team who were really helpful during the course of the release.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And recently we also added the functionality for ad hoc props to be given in the Slack props channel, and those get added to your profile activity. So that someone can give you basically a public thanks for having helped on something that they were working on. And then that gets logged in your activity tracker on your WordPress.org profile.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final question in that first big question is who tracks these props? And the answer is human beings! Which is why folks feel like they have to do a ton of things before they even get props. And that&#8217;s also why I&#8217;d like to automate more and more of them so that you don&#8217;t have to do a ton of things in order for someone to show up and acknowledge that you are part of a solution.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:51]&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the second question that I&#8217;ve seen kind of running around is, where do props start? And that is a great question that has been asked year after year. And one that I think we should continue to ask. The reality is that we won&#8217;t be able to see every contribution to WordPress, but that doesn&#8217;t mean that they aren&#8217;t valuable. And it doesn&#8217;t mean that they don&#8217;t matter.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building our culture of generosity helps us to better recognize and celebrate each other for all of our contributions, whether they are for a major release or a major event, or one of these new ad hoc props that you can offer to people. And if we see more and more of the same type of contributions being celebrated, then we can also work toward automating those as well, so that you don&#8217;t have to do a super ton of them before someone has noticed that you&#8217;ve done even one of them.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the third big question that has been running around is, what about the people who don&#8217;t want the props? If people want to be literally anonymous, then deletion requests are probably your way to go. But I actually don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the question here. I think the question is what if a prop holds no intrinsic value to you and then, you know, I wanna thank you for that spirit of generosity. And I also wanna say that I&#8217;m so glad you&#8217;re here.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:09:02]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully, all of these answers clarify what lies at the heart of what is intended with the Five for the Future initiative and the program that&#8217;s built on top of it. And why I care so much about fixing the ways we offer props to folks. For me, it&#8217;s not about assessing the worthiness of people or companies or any of their contributions. For me, it&#8217;s about reinvesting in the shared commons of the WordPress ecosystem, by finding a way that our economy can entice folks to put back into WordPress, something close to the benefit that they receive from it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that brings us now to our small list of big things. Thank you all for making it into the final stretches with me. These three things that I&#8217;m sharing also have companion blog posts to go with them because they are very big questions or very big features, very big plugin kind of things that we&#8217;re looking at. And so you&#8217;ll be able to find those in the show notes, or you can go to wordpress.org/news if you&#8217;re listening to this in a podcast player of your choice that is not wordpress.org.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:10:10]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So the first one on my list is a new plugin. It is called Create Block Theme. And it&#8217;s gonna make it easier for theme builders to use the existing site editor tools to create new block themes. I&#8217;m very excited about this. Uh, you can find it on make.wordpress.org/themes. And I will also include a link to it in the show notes below.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If themes are not your area of expertise, but you are interested in documentation or the DevHub or to an extent design things, then the improvements that are being worked on for the DevHub are definitely in your area. That&#8217;s kind of a Meta task, but has a few other pieces involved as well. That can be found on make.wordpress.org/meta. But again, I will have a link to the very, very detailed blog post in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s got a bunch of hypothetical changes that are being suggested for the WordPress developer docs, uh, especially when it comes to the function reference. And so there are gonna be some slight design questions, but not like, graphic design/visual design, more in the like, can humans read this design area of things? And so that will be a good one to look at. If you are sort of in the Meta or Documentation vein of things in the way that you like to contribute to WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:011:30]&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the final thing is about open sourcing theme designs. So open sourcing everything obviously is important to us. And the design tool that we use, this tool called Figma, is open to the public. And so it&#8217;s possible for folks to be able to kind of get in there and use and reuse any design elements.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s a discussion happening over on make.wordpress.org/design about how that can and should look in the future. And so if design is definitely your area, and again, this kind of lines up with themes a little bit, then wander over into that one, for which there will also be a link in the show notes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13132\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:27;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:60:\"\n		\n		\n		\n		\n		\n				\n		\n		\n\n					\n										\n					\n		\n		\n			\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:4:{s:0:\"\";a:6:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:36:\"The Month in WordPress – June 2022\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:68:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/07/the-month-in-wordpress-june-2022/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 06 Jul 2022 14:19:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:8:\"category\";a:2:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"Month in WordPress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}i:1;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:18:\"month in wordpress\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13069\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:1:{s:11:\"isPermaLink\";s:5:\"false\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:313:\"With WordPress 6.1 already in the works, a lot of updates happened during June.

The potential and power of blogs would be an influence in the rest of his life.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image aligncenter size-full is-resized\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://i1.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?fit=720%2C960&amp;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo sat in front of a pond. \" class=\"wp-image-13027\" width=\"720\" height=\"960\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?w=720&amp;ssl=1 720w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/leo-gopal.jpeg?resize=225%2C300&amp;ssl=1 225w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>As Leo&#8217;s confidence grew through expressing himself in writing, he was determined that his stutter would &#8216;no longer hold power over him&#8217;. In 2005, with the encouragement of his blog readers, he spent his school summer break in his room working on reducing his stutter. WordPress would be the tool that would enable him to connect with his blog readers and to express his creativity and thoughts.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Making WordPress your own</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In high school, Leo had opted for programming as one of his subjects. In 2008, he built his first website using WordPress for the students at the school. This was the first time he saw the real value of WordPress and open source.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During the following years, he increasingly spent time searching online for information on &#8216;Customising WordPress&#8217; and &#8216;Making WordPress your own&#8217;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo wanted to keep busy and as soon as he finished school, he applied for every entry-level web-related job that he could find. He was hired by a company for the role of webmaster for its Marketing team focused on WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He continued to grow his skills as a WordPress developer with the help of useful documentation that he could find and through his helpful local WordPress Community. This helped him earn a living and support his family.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Helping yourself through helping others in the community</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2015, Leo moved full-time to Cape Town, South Africa, and started as a developer at a web development agency, eventually progressing to its Head of Development and managing a small team.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He chose WordPress as his main platform for development mainly because of the community behind it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Had it not been for those searches on how to make WordPress your own, my life would have turned out a lot differently</em>.”&nbsp;</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo felt he had a hurdle to overcome working in web sector. He didn’t feel like a ‘real developer’ being self-taught. However, through the community, he realized that there were many self-taught developers and he was not alone.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alongside his development path, Leo faced a mental health journey. He had suffered from depression and found the community to be accepting and understanding of this.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At WordCamp Cape Town 2016, he stood in front of an audience and gave a talk: “<a href=\"https://wordpress.tv/2016/11/24/leo-gopal-the-wordpress-community-mental-wellness-and-you/\">The WordPress Community, Mental Wellness, and You</a>”. Following this talk, he was greeted by many attendees who thanked him for talking so openly about mental health issues.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at the podium at WordCamp Cape Town in 2016\" class=\"wp-image-13023\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?w=1024&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-2.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2016</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has been diagnosed with bipolar, previously known as manic depression. In 2017, he hit a low period and struggled to keep going. He found support and understanding in the community in WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has openly written about his experiences with depression and started an initiative where topics of mental health and general wellbeing can be freely and non-judgmentally discussed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He said that by helping others, he is helping himself, every day.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributing to WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo has contributed to the community as a Co-organizer in South Africa for the 2016 and 2017 WordCamp Cape Town, WordPress Meetup Cape Town 2015 &#8211; 2016, and WordPress Durban 2017 – 2020. He has also spoken at a number of WordCamps.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maintaining connections with people he had met through these events Leo felt was a great aid to his mental wellbeing during the Covid pandemic. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>He has contributed to core and plugins and believes that WordPress and its community make it extremely easy to contribute. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>The cost to start contributing is extremely low &#8211; start now</em>”.</p><cite>Leo Gopal</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>When the ability to create and add patterns to the WordPress.org library came out in 2021, Leo used it almost immediately and created a <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/patterns/pattern/call-to-action-section-2/\">call-to-action box</a> which could be used by both his clients and the community. He plans to release a few more complex patterns.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Yes, we can.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Leo’s mantra is “I can do it!”</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"683\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"Leo speaking at a WordCamp Cape Town in 2019\" class=\"wp-image-13032\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1024%2C683&amp;ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=300%2C200&amp;ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=768%2C512&amp;ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?resize=1536%2C1024&amp;ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/06/Leo-speaking-3.jpeg?w=1944&amp;ssl=1 1944w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1000px) 100vw, 1000px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption class=\"wp-element-caption\"><em>Leo speaking at a WordCamp</em> Cape Town, 2019</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Getting over a stutter, overcoming poverty, being urgently self-taught, growing up in a country with “load shedding” electricity outages, and one of the slowest rated internet speeds in the developing world, and strengthening mental wellness are not easy feats., And yet, he knows he can do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>“<em>Never, ever think you do not have the &#8216;right&#8217; circumstances for success.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, the podcast where you can catch quick explanations of some of the ideas behind the WordPress open source project and the community around it, as well as get a small list of big things coming up in the next two weeks. I&#8217;m your host Josepha Haden Chomphosy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right my friends. So it&#8217;s been about a month since WordPress 6.0 came out and you know what that means. It means we are already looking at the next major WordPress release because,&nbsp; as most of you know, WordPress never sleeps. Y&#8217;all are honestly up and hustling like 24/7 as far as I can tell, which is great! And is one of the many benefits of being a global community, I suppose.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:01:05]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But anyway, back to this major release. There was a high-level roadmap shared by Mattias Ventura at the start of June. And it lists some focus areas for the Block Editor, continued refinements to the template editor and navigation block, and some work on global styles and more / better blocks and design tools that are slated to ship with WordPress 6.1. From the WordPress core side, though, there are a couple hundred tickets that are milestoned for the next major.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Being milestoned for a release means that either a ticket wasn&#8217;t ready for the last release and was moved to the next available one, or a ticket has become ready for a release since the last major release occurred. That list as it stands might be a little bit too big for a single release. However, honestly, no list is too big if we have enough folks contributing.<br></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you&#8217;ve never contributed to a major release of WordPress before, and you&#8217;re interested to know how that works, there are some things to keep an eye out for over the next few weeks. We are in what is considered the planning phase for the next big release. And so there are two or three things you&#8217;re gonna see pretty soon.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:02:11]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>First is a planning kickoff post. That post gets published on make.wordpress.org/core, and it includes notes on volunteering for the release squad, some guesses at areas of focus based on the tickets that we&#8217;re seeing in track, a schedule, the whole kit, and caboodle. It&#8217;s all in there. If you are wanting to know how to lend a hand and how to take your first steps to core contribution, apart from the new contributor meeting that happens before the dev chat, that post is the place to start.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So keep an eye out on make.wordpress.org/core for that. And then the second thing that shows up in the planning phase for any major release is bug scrub and ticket triage meetings. Like I mentioned, there are the new contributor meetings where they scrub tickets and talk through the basics of what we&#8217;re seeing on good first bugs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I mentioned that here often, I just mentioned it in the last, in the last bullet point, but there are also regular bug scrubs and ticket triaging sessions where a kind contributor chooses a set of tickets to review and then leads other contributors through the process of checking to see if a ticket is valid to see if it can be replicated to see if it has a patch.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:03:23]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If there are decisions that are blocking it and how to move those decisions forward, and generally just kind of discuss what else has to be done in order to take the ticket to the next step. Those get announced in the dev chat every Wednesday, but also there is a post that will go up on make.wordpress.org/core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I wish I had a faster way to say that instead of just racing through the whole URL every time. But it&#8217;ll be okay. We&#8217;ll put it in the show notes in case you would rather just click some stuff. And the third thing to keep an eye out for. If development is not your thing, so writing code is not already part of your tool belt, that&#8217;s totally fine. There are many other important areas where you can contribute, too. Design, training, support, polyglots, marketing, documentation, and more. These teams all do work in and around a release that is vital to WordPress&#8217; overall success.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:04:19]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And a final thought of all. If that felt a little too intense if you want to see where this ship is headed, but you can&#8217;t quite commit to grabbing an oar today, that&#8217;s fine, too. The most important thing is that if you are a member of the community, as an extender or a user or a die-hard contributor, or a new contributor, the most important thing is that you have some general awareness of what the overall direction is.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You might do that by experimenting with blocks in your products or by testing screen readers against your workflow or even by setting aside an hour to participate in the latest testing prompt. Being aware of what&#8217;s happening in and around your area of the project will help to keep you kind of prepared and knowledgeable to lend a hand whenever it is that you are ready.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:05:14]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that then brings us to our small list of big things. My friends, registration is now open for the WordPress Speaker Workshop for Women Voices in India. That&#8217;s taking place on September 24th and 25th. Uh, it&#8217;s happening over Zoom, so location or travel shouldn&#8217;t really be an obstacle for you. I&#8217;m going to leave a link to some information about that in the show notes. It should be an excellent opportunity that [the] WP Diversity initiative that WordPress has, that the community team helps to foster, is really an excellent experience. And so I hope that you register and attend that.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the second thing actually is a bit of a celebration. The Photo Directory recently hit a huge milestone of 3000 photos! And you also can submit your photos to wordpress.org/photos. If you feel so inclined to make a contribution of that type.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[<strong>Josepha Haden Chomphosy </strong>00:06:07]&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the third thing on my smallest of big things is actually kind of a, a WordPress tooltip a little bit of a WordPress project did-ya-know? So, there is a special channel in WordPress Slack for sharing thanks to folks who were especially helpful to you. It&#8217;s called the Props Channel. And when someone shares props with you, it even shows up in your activity on your wordpress.org profile. Pretty cool, huh? Props to the Meta team for that one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that my friends is your small list of big things. Thank you for tuning in today for the WordPress Briefing. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. And I&#8217;ll see you again in a couple of weeks.</p>\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:7:\"post-id\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"13013\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}s:27:\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\";a:1:{s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:0:\"\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:1:{s:0:\"\";a:3:{s:4:\"href\";s:32:\"https://wordpress.org/news/feed/\";s:3:\"rel\";s:4:\"self\";s:4:\"type\";s:19:\"application/rss+xml\";}}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:44:\"http://purl.org/rss/1.0/modules/syndication/\";a:2:{s:12:\"updatePeriod\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:9:\"\n	hourly	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:15:\"updateFrequency\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:4:\"\n	1	\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:30:\"com-wordpress:feed-additions:1\";a:1:{s:4:\"site\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8:\"14607090\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:\"type\";i:128;s:7:\"headers\";O:42:\"Requests_Utility_CaseInsensitiveDictionary\":1:{s:7:\"\0*\0data\";a:9:{s:6:\"server\";s:5:\"nginx\";s:4:\"date\";s:29:\"Mon, 14 Nov 2022 10:08:06 GMT\";s:12:\"content-type\";s:34:\"application/rss+xml; charset=UTF-8\";s:25:\"strict-transport-security\";s:11:\"max-age=360\";s:6:\"x-olaf\";s:3:\"⛄\";s:13:\"last-modified\";s:29:\"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 17:09:41 GMT\";s:4:\"link\";s:63:\"<https://wordpress.org/news/wp-json/>; rel=\"https://api.w.org/\"\";s:15:\"x-frame-options\";s:10:\"SAMEORIGIN\";s:4:\"x-nc\";s:9:\"HIT ord 2\";}}s:5:\"build\";s:14:\"20221007055323\";}','no'),(564,'_transient_timeout_feed_mod_9bbd59226dc36b9b26cd43f15694c5c3','1668463687','no'),(565,'_transient_feed_mod_9bbd59226dc36b9b26cd43f15694c5c3','1668420487','no'),(566,'_transient_timeout_feed_d117b5738fbd35bd8c0391cda1f2b5d9','1668463689','no');

Kicking off a series of Product and Agency Founder episodes of <strong>Post Status Draft</strong>, <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-in-the-long-view-with-james-farmer-post-status-draft-129/\">Cory chatted with James</a> about everything from his launch of the first hosted WordPress multisite blogging platform — just a few days ahead of WordPress.com — to his views on Gutenberg, how he stays competitive with <strong>Squarespace</strong>, and how he thinks the WordPress business community should pull together to do more for themselves, collectively. <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-in-the-long-view-with-james-farmer-post-status-draft-129/\">WATCH/LISTEN→</a></p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a similar vein <strong>Eric Karkovack</strong> put out <a href=\"https://thewpminute.com/the-wordpress-ecosystem-needs-closer-scrutiny/\">a call for greater scrutiny of the WordPress ecosystem</a> by those with the power to influence it for the better. We got in <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/CHNM7Q7T8/p1668029348422229\">an extended discussion of the possibilities</a> in Post Status Slack. Eric would like to see &#8220;voluntary standards&#8221; developed and promoted by WordPress product owners and developers who see the stake they have in a healthy WordPress ecosystem. Spreading &#8220;best practices in code and business&#8221; would make it a lot healthier. <strong>Zach Stepek</strong>, <strong>Lesley Sim</strong>, <strong>Carl Alexander</strong>, and Patrick Leblanc rounded out the conversation with the possibilities, including the barriers and frustrations, for such a project.

Despite handling support tickets quickly, <strong>PluginRank</strong> and personal testing showed a steep drop on key search tags. The resulting discussion was instructive and surfaced frustrations we\'ve heard a lot with the <strong>Plugin Team</strong>&#8216;s typical response. <strong>Marius Jensen</strong> and <strong>Greg Brown</strong> chimed in to show the search algorithm is &#8220;fully transparent&#8221; and hasn\'t changed. The general conclusion was that competition from other plugins is likely driving the changes, which can be dramatic but don\'t necessarily correspond to any dips in revenue for the plugin owner.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Could voluntary standards clean up the plugin market?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s unfortunate but typical that basic guidelines for success on the plugin repository are scattered and part of the vast realm of WordPress &#8220;lore&#8221; that never spreads very far from WordPress insiders. (<strong>Freemius</strong> has <a href=\"https://freemius.com/blog/seo-on-new-plugin-repository/\">a handy, free guide</a>, however.) Surfacing more of this knowledge would likely remove some barriers to entry for newcomers and maybe help reduce the pressure to turn to novel, aggressive, and perhaps &#8220;mercenary&#8221; tactics. At the same time, it also seems clear that competing only or even primarily on the repo is an unnecessary and limiting misstep. The competition between 60k+ plugins all in one place is high, and as <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/member-spotlight-igor-ligay/\">Igor Ligay</a></strong> (<strong>StyleMix</strong>) noted, there are no categories or tags to filter them, so your plugin\'s fate is in the hands of the site\'s <strong>ElasticSearch</strong> engine — and <strong>Google</strong>. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-kadence-spacer aligncenter kt-block-spacer-_fd77f1-31\"><div class=\"kt-block-spacer kt-block-spacer-halign-center\"><hr class=\"kt-divider\" /></div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-how-do-you-get-plugin-telemetry\">How do you get plugin telemetry?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>This week <strong>Rohit Singhal</strong> (<strong>Xtendify</strong>) asked how others are <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/CHNM7Q7T8/p1667314812791079\">tracking how customers use new features</a> in plugins or themes. <strong><a href=\"https://amplitude.com/\">Amplitude</a></strong>, <strong><strong><a href=\"https://mixpanel.com/\">Mixpanel</a></strong></strong>, <strong><a href=\"https://jitsu.com/\">Jitsu</a></strong>, and <strong>Google Analytics</strong> are his tools of choice.

Brent previously worked at <a href=\"https://spatie.be/\"><strong>Spat</strong>ie</a> and is now a PHP developer advocate at JetBrains, so it makes sense that his employer would want to use his existing YouTube channel and followers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As before, the channel is focused on engaging with the PHP community.

Every time I look at my account, the settings, access, and options change. Sometimes overnight. Sometimes seemingly every fifteen minutes. There is a lot that happens on Twitter in the WordPress community. So it begs the question, where will you go if it all ends in a fiery crash like a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zn_oKmaqS34\">SpaceX Rocket</a>, or runs out of energy like a <a href=\"https://www.autoevolution.com/news/tesla-model-3-owner-gets-stranded-in-the-middle-of-the-freeway-in-her-third-drive-201326.html\">Tesla on the side of the road</a>.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Finding each other isn’t necessarily the difficult part.

It’s building the rapport in a new “main place” that is challenging, as well as finding new ways and locations to seek out and connect with customers and clients.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mastodon is gaining in popularity, but there is a slight learning curve. And it’s a bit like shouting “Marco” into the void and not hearing anyone shout back “Polo” back when trying to find connections.

I\'m excited to have this conversation today. Um, my special guest is James Farmer, founder of Wpm U Dev, and, um, I\'ve known of James. I think I\'ve got to meet him maybe once. I know we\'ve talked before, but you know, as far back as James goes with WordPress, And the cool stuff he was doing at the beginning when I knew about him.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now, fast forward to today, I thought this would be a very relevant conversation. And if you know anything about James, he, uh, knows his stuff and has opinions and, and I like his opinions, and I want to hear those. So, uh, James, thanks for coming on the, uh, uh, post status draft, uh, pleasure. In doing this conversation with me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s fun to, to, uh, hear your voice and hear what you\'re doing and get your thoughts on some things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> Uh, it\'s a pleasure to be here. Thank you for the invitation. It\'s, um, it\'s, yeah, it\'s really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Uh, you were just telling me, uh, it\'s like [00:01:00] beautiful sunny skies in Melbourne where I think you\'re based, uh, this morning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So thanks for joining us early for your time. .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> Yeah. No, it\'s, um, it\'s just, uh, spring has finally arrived. We we\'re currently having a, a big wet, as it\'s called in Australia, which means that it\'s just rain, rain, rain everywhere. But finally it\'s sunny and nice and, uh, we\'re, uh, rolling into our, into our, towards our.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Awesome. Well, I\'m jealous. I, I want to get to Australia at some point, and I haven\'t been there and, and hope to see in person and, and see the country. Well, absolutely. Okay. I\'m gonna dive right in, James, because I\'m, I\'m interested in these questions and I want to hear your thoughts and, and opinions on things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the first is just like, I know you as an early pioneer in WordPress in the, in the product space in particular. Um, but there\'s some people that may not know some of the backstory. So could you tell us like how you get got started with WordPress and then what the point where W P M U [00:02:00] started, you know, that kind of origin story?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause I\'m,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> I\'m curious to hear for myself. Yeah, for sure. Um, no trouble at all. So, so way back in the midst of time, I was interested in blogging as an educational tool. I was a, I was a teacher, um, and uh, English as a foreign language. And then, um, kind of, uh, working in that area and then education design.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I started to, I wanted to use blogs for like, education purposes and, um, I had a look around and I found this piece of software called Radio User Land by Dave Wener. And it\'s this fantastic. Piece of software, um, you kind of wrote it and on your every, managed everything on your desktop and it kind of pushed it to a static HTML site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you know, radical</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, you could even call it headless maybe. I dunno. But, but, but, um, but yeah, that would\'ve been, oh man, 2003. And, um, I started my. Blog, James Farmer\'s Radio web blog. And um, I got a link [00:03:00] from, um, from Dave Wener himself cuz um, probably cuz I was using his software and I think I got described as an enthusiastic new edgy blogger and, uh, and so I kind of got into it that way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and then a year later my subscription was coming up and, uh, I\'d heard about this, you know, kind of, um, this other interest. Software that was out there, there\'s this thing called movable type, um, which is doing all right. It\'s quite pretty. There\'s this single WordPress everyone was raving about. And so I thought, well, you know, might as well learn how to install something on a server, also learn what, what a server is and</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the level of my technical ability and um, and so I kind of did all the steps and talked myself through and set up a WordPress blog. Um, yeah, in 2004, I think called Incorporated sub versions. Which was all about educational philosophy of incorporating subversion into the design of your software, which then eventually became Ink Sub [00:04:00] cuz Incorporated and Subversion kind of went together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and um, that was, um, that was kind of, um, how I originally got started.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So, uh, 2004. So you got me. Um, similarity, you know, 2006, one, I used this software. You may remember back in the day, because I had no coding, I still don\'t have any coding experience, but Claris homepage on the Mac and building my website, I was like, this is ridiculous, trying to update my copyright footer or something when something changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But before WordPress, mine was Google, uh, was blog. Ah yes. Cause you could publish things to the thing, but when you said weblog, it took me back to that web period.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> Like I know Go golden period dm. The, what I really wanted to do like this, the core thing was I really wanted to do is I wanted to start like a blogger kind of service for students so that rather than people like typing in like [00:05:00] discussion boards and doing all that flat boardy kinda stuff, which is still doing amazingly, just, it makes me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shutter . I could think about the state of educational technology, but the, um, so rather than doing, um, that, um, they would each have their own site and people would have their own profile and a bit like a kind of proto face Facebook kind of experience. And, um, Radio use had this other bit of software called Manila, which allowed you to do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this was hideously complex and incredibly hard to put together. And I worked with like some of the IT guys in, um, the school where I was at the time, R M I T, English Worldwide. And we just tried to do it and we kind of got it together and it kind of didn\'t work so. So when, um, I discovered WordPress, I was really enjoying it because, you know, it\'s as, as we all know, it\'s a fantastic blogging platform and it was so much kind of more fun and interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I could play with things and these plugins, which was so much better than this kind of static publishing thing where you\'d have to tweet gates also, not a coder. Terrible tweaking. I mean, like, yeah, the way back machine will demonstrate [00:06:00] very clearly my, my, my, my, my design and uh, coding talents. But, um, then the, the real thing for me, the thing that when it really kicked off was when I\'m gonna mispronounce his name cuz I always have done that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve never been on to Donica, put together this WordPress m u thing as a side project and I was like, holy shit. That\'s how I can do blogger for the students. They could put this together. Oh my word. And so I just, I just went to town on that and working on that. And I tried loads of examples and set ups and things here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, it wasn\'t working. It wasn\'t working. And then, um, I, at the same time, Matt went over to Ireland to, um, to do some work with Donica. I\'m sorry, Donica, please. I really am sort of the misappropriation, , the um, They went over to Ireland and they kind of re re uh, rejigged. What would you, what would you call it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, oh man, they\'re always doing it in our plugins. Refactored, refactored, WordPress, mu refactored, WordPress mu. [00:07:00] And, um, and turned into this really nice thing and I was like, Oh my God, it\'s even better. And I was having a glass of wine at home one night. And just dood noodling around with this. And, um, I, I owned at that point, I think about like four domain names, or three domain names.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\'d add Insub, which was my blog and a couple of others, like for friends and family. But because I was an edgy blogger, um, I\'d also, you know, I\'d been like, Oh, I wonder if there\'s anything about edgy page blogs. And, and edgy blog.org was available for like, you know, 8 95. And so I was like, Oh, cool. I buy that and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Had this, I was sitting on this flat leather couch in the suburb of Melbourne at 7:00 PM couple of glass of red, and I just thought, what about if I put this new WordPress, SMU stuff onto edgy blogs.org and then just posted about it and saw what happened. And so I did that and um, it took a while. It was a bit hard, and I woke up the next day and like 80 people had created.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was like, [00:08:00] Yeah, like my, my jaw hit the floor. It was astonishing because all of these people in the blogging community, most people using probably movable type, some people using radio use land as DRO or users, people like kind of, you know, all sorts of different platforms and everyone was. Everyone was interested in WordPress and what WordPress was, but you know, like nobody really necessarily had the capacity or the extra area or even the coding ability to try it out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you could just set up a WordPress site and play with WordPress. People are like, Oh yeah, hell yeah, I\'ll do that. And, um, I think, um, my, my claim to fame is that, um, that, uh, edgy.org predated wordpress.com by four weeks. So they, they, There you go. See, that\'s where, and, and that\'s why I\'m a billionaire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I nothing</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> I love that. I, I thought I knew the origins of WMU as well, like your company name now, [00:09:00] um, heavy with the, Oh, what\'s, what does image stand for? Multiuse. I think you, So</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> actually, uh, mu actually, here\'s an interesting fact. Not a lot of people No, it\'s actually the Greek letter of the alphabet Mu Okay. Um, which actually was actually done by a little symbol that looks like this, and essentially it means infas or multiple, multiple and things there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it never was WordPress Mu, it was actually WordPress. But of course, you know, nobody understood that, understood that or figured that out. So it became WordPress mu And then of course later on, um, after, uh, Ida utterly dominated the WPP size, a bottle of domains, WordPress multi-site, which I got a little bit, I got a little bit salty about that change</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, but, but we survived and we\'re still here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Uh, so I remember the symbol now that you\'re saying. Um, connected to that way back, so I\'m getting some nostalgia here too, thinking about, because it was always [00:10:00] this cool thing that you could do. And, um, and you did it well with edgy blogs and that\'s how I remember, you know, um, hearing about what you were doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it was Word Camp San Francisco, one of the first ones. Mm-hmm. that I think you presented. If I, if I\'m not mistaken. Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> I don\'t think I presented at it. I don\'t, I did, I did. Um, I did the first. Word Words Camp, um, in the Southern Hemisphere. Um, word camp down un down under, um, in, uh, in Melbourne, in Docklands.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that might have, it might have been from there. That would be, uh, our original kind of thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So then Edge bro, edgy blogs took off, I think from what I, what I understand. And then how did, how did you get to Wpm U Dev, what you\'re doing now in some form?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> So, um, I, I, as, as I mentioned probably mentions route, I\'m, I\'m not much of a developer or a coder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'m actually not a developer or a coder. And, um, uh, but I, I wanted things [00:11:00] jilo, you know, I wanted this feature or this sort of thing or, and this extra functionality to be added to, you know, like, uh, simple things like, you know, kind of take the remember me box by. Or, um, slightly more complex ones, like where I wanted to put like a donate bus in so people could support it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, so I was, um, kneeling around on the forums. Um, with, um, you know, back in the day there was a, I think the, there was a separate, like WordPress move. Forum area. I don\'t think it was part of the original WordPress org one. And I\'m chatting to people and they\'re asking \'em questions and eventually I ended up chatting to this guy called Andrew Billz, who, um, was also on there and asked him like, maybe, you know, if I kind of like gave him, I didn\'t have very much money, a few bucks or something, or if we could do some exchange, I could do something and could he do a few things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we started pottering. Um, kind of help him, helping me with a few things like that. And also at the same time, he had set up [00:12:00] a site called wpm u dev.org, which, um, he was basically using, uh, essentially wordpress.org was set up for WordPress stuff. It had nothing related to this new mu stuff. It was separate thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so he set that up in order to basically be plum, who would just be about WordPress. Cause that\'s what we were interested and that\'s what we were playing with. And. So we kind of continued to kind of work together and done those little things. And then around about 2006 when this kind of like progressed on and edgy blocks had taken on, LED started like a sideline of it called Edgy Blocks Campus, which is now Campus press, the education provider, um, the, um, but uh, we, um, interesting campus.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Best fact, I think I\'m allowed to say it here. We\'re not allowed to put it on our marketing material, but, um, Harvard, um, business school employed Dave Winer for a year as a visiting fellow to set up their blogging platform on Manila. You know, the platform I was [00:13:00] talking about, set off radio use land as an early business thing there, and now Harvard runs on WordPress powered by campus press.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is . That\'s awesome. I know. It\'s so awesome. I\'m so happy about that. It only took like 15 years of like constantly pestering them going, Please, please, please use us. Please let us help you. But yeah, we can\'t be confident in marketing material. But I think you can mention it, someone like that I suppose.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I suppose I will find out if, um, if we can\'t with some angry emails, in which case, Sorry. Sorry, Harvard, I\'m just boasting cause I\'m pleased about it. Yeah, it\'s a nice story. . Um, the um, but. Uh, so, so basically it, it had progressed and then I got this like contact from a, um, football management game that I\'d actually played, um, saying we\'d like to make a football related kind of thing here, just like edge blogs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They found me through edge blogs and, um, to my utter shock, I put forward a proposal for, I think it was like 50 grand. [00:14:00] And they were like, Yeah, that sounds reasonable, . And I was like, What, how could anybody spend this amount of money? Are you insane? And they flew me to, um, San Francisco, um, to do it. I spoke to Andrew.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Andrew, um, was gonna be the developer and put all this stuff together. I was gonna do the business and the content and the structure and the project management and those things. And we did, we put it together. It was called football united.com. That\'s really cool. But then I said to Andrew, Well, you know, how about, you know, like, rather than, Employing you these things here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How about we actually join up together and we, we form a company and we do this stuff together and split it 50 50. And um, he was like, Yeah, cool. And I was like, you know, and um, you could have 10% of ed blogs. What is worth is making no money. And, you know, kind of, we can bring in W P U Dev, you know, this, um, free repository place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I didn\'t really have any ideas for it. We can just pull our ideas and work together. And we did. And hence ink. Which is the company name, because it was a free domain name I had lying [00:15:00] around. I was like, Well, I\'ve got this.com, why don\'t we use this? And hence, Y W P Dev then became part of iub.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Okay, I got it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> The story, story . Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. I, I always love these, hearing these origin stories because they, um, you know, it starts with this wonder, like you said, I wonder if. We could do this and I wonder if or, or how things evolve over time because like, This started with a, what if that became edgy blogs and then eventually Ink Sub Wpm U Dev kind of came out of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we\'re here today in 2020. So it\'s crazy thinking back too. But I love hearing the stories of how they evolved because, uh, I\'m the same way, you know, I\'m not a developer either, and, uh, . So I I love that. Um, okay, so that\'s some of the backstory. I wanted, I wanted to share that or you to share that because I want people to know there\'s some things we could have a whole conversation on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Movable [00:16:00] type, right? Some of those Oh yeah. , because I remember that too. And uh, some of the mis moves they made, missteps they made that really helped propel word, presidents level. Yeah. Yeah know. But I wanna set this , right? . I wanna set that stage though, to say you\'ve been doing this a long time, James, and you\'ve seen a lot of the evolution of WordPress and the industry, the market, the growth, some of the things that have changed over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so it was good to share that story, but we could just camp out an entrepreneurial, But I really want to also, okay, in this. Second step is like, go, Okay, now setting the stage, tell me how, where Wpm U is today. And, uh, then I wanna talk about technology. I wanna talk about the web, and I wanna talk about WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I wanna get your, your thoughts on all these things. So where is Sounds good today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> Cool. Right. So, Wp Me Dev today has evolved from its various plugin forms into [00:17:00] something. It\'s somewhere halfway between plugins and a service and a hosting platform. Can you be halfway between three things? Absolutely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so. Um, I, yeah, so, so essentially we\'ve, we\'ve offer a, you know, kind of a core suite of plugins, you know, for security performance. Um, we\'ve actually got a really good SEO plugin, but we just marketed terribly by name, name terribly by me. Um, and, um, you know, kind of a form builder and, uh, security, I said security deni already.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then we\'ve got like a site management area that, uh, you know, very. To manage WP in some respects, but it allows you to look after all of those different things. But you, first and foremost, really over the last few years has been a hosting product, um, which is, um, built on top of, um, ation and lions infrastructure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, you node, depending upon your preference there. Yeah. Which, which, which offers a really, a [00:18:00] really different, um, managed, um, WordPress experience that\'s really catered directly for, uh, for resellers. Web developers, freelancers, agencies who are, um, you know, catering to, um, clients who are often small businesses or medium businesses and those things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we\'re essentially trying to provide all the tools, the platform, the background to save them time, save them money, and help them produce really cool sites. That\'s what we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And yeah. And how, how big is your team today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> The whole ink sub team is, uh, it fluctuates a bit cuz we, we, we hire quite a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We try and hire everybody at a junior, um, level or mid level. I mean like our entire exec team is like, you know, people who started basically as junior staff things. In fact, um, I think tmr coo, I turned him down twice, got rejected. It\'s always, always fun to think about you. Not good enough, . Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> he\'s a who by the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I\'ve got to meet him a [00:19:00] couple</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> times. , He\'s, he\'s a, he\'s a, he\'s good value, isn\'t he? He\'s a great manager as well. Um, so, um, yeah. But, um, so we, so the numbers vary, but I think we\'re about 175. 176. Fantastic. Is those Yeah, it\'s cool. It\'s amazing. It shocks me, to be honest with you. I\'m still a. But, um, we are, um, But yeah, we\'ve, we\'ve, we\'ve done some nice things and people, um, meeting up and stuff and we are doing, um, next April, we\'re having our first, not our first, cause we did one in New York back today, but our first proper company retreat and we\'re all gonna go to Bali.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I dunno if you\'ve been to Bali. It\'s a, it\'s a lovely place in Indonesia, um, just north of, um, Australia. And, uh, we\'re staying over. Yeah, yeah. Bar. Yeah. And so, and so we we\'re going for a week with 60. Is so exciting. It\'s gonna be so cool. It\'s like, I was like, ah, I like do a couple of days work and then mostly just hang out and chat and see.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can see the sites, you can go to bars, you [00:20:00] can do all sorts of different things. But um, yeah, I\'m, I\'m, I\'m super excited about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, I get that elbow time. Well, I love that and congratulations to hear kind of the before, how it gets started now today, and one thing, you know, I paid attention to Wpm U Death for a long time, but a couple things I\'ve always admired is, one is you have a tool set of things that if you wanna build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or press sites and things like that. You\'ve got it like it seemed like grown over time. I\'d go back when I was still running Ithe and go, How the heck are they doing all of this stuff with</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> like this? Yeah. Yeah. With a great deal of effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> And I\'ve been on the emails for a long time too, and I\'ve always admired too the content production that you all have done historically through Wpm U Oh, thank you so.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So cool. Well have fun in Bali for sure. And tell Tim, um, uh, hi</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> for me. I will, I\'ll pass it on. He said he was looking forward to the live version of this. [00:21:00] He got some. I bet he, I was gonna sit back, but, uh, But it\'s all good. He can, uh, this way he can watch it as many times as he liked.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Exactly. Then he can\'t throw tomatoes and different things at us</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, okay. So thank you for that. And then I wanna come back as we wrap up and talk about what you\'re doing, what you\'re excited about, uh, with Wpm U as well, and, um, one of the, you know, pioneers in the space and WordPress and the product space. Um, but I wanna take some time and I wanna get your thoughts on some things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay? Sure. So, and with all this experience and what you\'ve seen, the evolution and all, you know, the ups and downs of entrepreneurship as well, but you. What\'s your, what\'s your outlook today? And this is the, I\'m gonna just start with the big one, the word press. You\'ve seen, you\'ve been there</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> for the, Sorry, sorry about the camera.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Doing all sorts of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> No, no, I like it cuz I, I want one because I\'ve just got a static one. You\'ve got one that moves, but, um, so, [00:22:00] As you look at, you see you\'ve been there. Uh, I think we were talking like early on with WordPress, even before mu uh, mu, excuse me, was like rolled out and stuff. And I think I came in, I was telling you before we were, we started recording that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think I came in somewhere in the two range, you know, when it was still blue and why, and it was like just one little horizontal menu and I was like, this is the best thing on earth. But you\'ve seen a lot. And so the first thing I wanted to ask out of the gate, Um, what do you think right now where WordPress is?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What\'s your outlook on where we are today, how it\'s grown, and any thoughts around just WordPress today?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> Ah, yeah, so. I mean, you know, it\'s, it\'s, every article about WordPress starts with WordPress powers. X percentage is a web. And you know, it does this and it does that. And I, I think if I was a, if I was a betting man, not besting man, but if I was, I would say that, um, where we\'re at now in [00:23:00] terms of saturation is probably about where we\'ll be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\'s, um, I don\'t think there\'s gonna be, um, um, a, uh, any necessary kind of, um, growth, um, apart from, you know, general growth as a web and people trading sites and so on, um, in a percentage market share. And I think that that\'s basically down to, um, the, uh, Squarespace, uh, Shopify reification of, um, of, uh, of, of the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, um, there\'s more and more people who. Able to use both because it\'s easier and because it\'s more accessible and know about tools like Squarespace, you know, everybody pretty much does. And, you know, and even, you know, MailChimp and so they\'re trying to come out with their versions of it, and they do a pretty decent job.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so if you are, um, a small business, which, or then, which is, like I said, Members, their clients, um, their clients are looking at like a kinda square space setup for , say, [00:24:00] might cost them two or 300 bucks a year. Or they\'re looking at hiring a web developer and getting this done and this done, this done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s like, I dunno, say let\'s say three to 10 grand a year. Then it\'s, it\'s like, well, I\'ll just put in the yards and figure it out myself. And I think that\'s a lot of that\'s gonna be happening and continuing to happen. I\'m optimistic in terms of WordPress pertain its market share because of course, you know, these third party platforms just don\'t have the flexibility or the options.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, also because, you know, they\'re heavily debt funded and, uh, they need to make money. And in doing so, they need to offer the kind of support and different levels and so on and so forth, which means that your square space, your square space, basic decent site with maybe a shopping card on it, is going to go towards five, $6,000 a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, possibly more, you know, maybe even kind of like two grand and then all of a sudden it starts to be, Oh, actually, well this is a more comfortable kind of [00:25:00] area. And we\'re, um, we are trying to make, um, one of the things we\'ve got rolling out next year is we\'re trying to essentially allow our. Members to create a kind of square space type automated provision environment with funky templates and all the cool things and WordPress built into it all their own templates so that, um, they can, you know, essentially have a, kind of build your own site option, which they can offer for their particular niche or area or those sorts of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I\'m hoping that we\'re doing our bit to, uh, to help us keep, keep up with the, um, with the Super Bowl ad buyers , but it\'s still, you know, it\'s a rough and tumble.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> So this, this is something I\'ve seen change in piggybacking on what you did. You know, when I started Ithe in 2008, um, it was the Wild West with themes because they wanted that kind of, you know, experience to be able to find a good theme and kind of do it themselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or a builder, a freelancer, kind of take it, mold [00:26:00] it. , and it\'s interesting over time, particularly with I Teams, we go, Okay, themes are getting saturated, and then you see this dynamic you talked about with Squarespace starting to come in going, and it felt like to me, James, that it, those players out there that didn\'t exist when WordPress was for sure getting, its like upward momentum didn\'t really exist and WordPress became an option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then over time, I was like, Golly, if you look into even web. Come into win flow and thinking that the tools around in the competitive landscape have gotten way better. You know, there\'s great experiences and it seems like it\'s shifted the market where it\'s the focus is a little bit more like, You\'re serving small businesses, for instance, and this web designer freelancer comes in and goes, Okay, you want this experience that\'s a little bit more complicated than you would, you could probably get on your own right now.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yep, yep, yep. It seems like, like the agencies and the freelancers I talked to, they\'re, it\'s, it\'s like, I wondered the other day, I was like, Okay, what, What happened to the, [00:27:00] you know, $2,000, $5,000 website? Mm-hmm. and back in the day, You know, you could get, like, that was, that was, that was the heyday of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I\'m, I\'m interested in your thoughts there too, like from those trends in WordPress, have you seen that too? Where it\'s like, there\'s really good options out there now? You said freedom and I, I\'m, I ring that bell as well and I, that\'s why I love WordPress. Cause I can do whatever I want with, and I\'m not locked in, but Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, some of those trends that you\'re seeing too out there with WordPress and its position in the market. I\'m, I\'m curious to hear your thoughts. That.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. It\'s, um, it\'s, uh, it\'s, it\'s fascinating. Um, and we, we talk to our members a lot. We do a lot of, um, surveys and where, where they\'re heading out, and I, I, there\'s a lot of very healthy businesses and there\'s a lot of people going in, in, in for it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But there\'s also, um, a lot of people who are receiving pushback from people in that are looking at that part. Kind of like, um, dollar bracket, if you will. I mean, when you\'re, when you\'re talking about, you know, [00:28:00] kind a kinda a medium size business, you know, of someone who\'s actually looking for, you know, a whole range of different things, and of course they\'re gonna need WordPress means patiently obvious.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you can\'t, um, have the, um, you know, the capacity to, um, offer anything near or even. Or even match the, um, how would I put it? The kinda regulatory, uh, requirements, um, that, um, you would be looking for and the level of support and the level of those things. And that, that\'s, that\'s, that\'s tied up.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s not going anywhere. But, um, it\'s the, um, it\'s the people. Say for example, um, I mate who runs a gym, You know, he\'s very much, his position is, ah, yeah, I\'ve got a square space website. I don\'t particularly like it. It\'s a bit annoying and I have to learn all this shit, but you know, it\'s a couple hundred bucks, 300 bucks, and I\'m not gonna spend five grand on something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s the person, that\'s the segment that\'s gonna be a problem. And the that segment is, is huge. There\'s a lot more of them. Out there and while it might not be, uh, the big bucks, you know, [00:29:00] uh, well the medium bucks, the, um, the, uh, it\'s, it\'s, it\'s super important and we are really trying to find ways to help people actually, you know, have an impact on that segment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, for example, like, um, with, um, you know, say our hosting, I\'m gonna say like, we\'ve got this new hosting product called, Which is a $4 or $3 60 a month managed WordPress hosting, which is pretty damn good. If you ask me. It gives you your own IP address. It gives, but anyway, I\'m not selling it there, but it\'s just something I\'m really excited about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if someone runs up a quantum site with a, say photography portfolio thing for like a wedding photographer or something, and then they run it on our system, then the all that they would have to spend essentially is $3 60 a. Um, they could put the template, everything in place. Um, we\'ve got a domains thing that\'s running out next week where, uh, we\'re actually doing wholesale domain pricing for all of our members who are like on the, our agency package.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So $11 50 for like, um, a.com. [00:30:00] Every month. No. No stupid discounts, No nothing. They can sell that to their customer for 20 bucks. They can sell them the hosting package for another 20 bucks or 25 bucks, and they can have a support add on or an extra theme for another 30, 40 bucks so they can actually, and they can have that automatically deployed on their site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For their customer who\'s then going to be paying them 80 bucks a month for their cost of under $15. And that\'s before you talk about support and all of those other different maintenance and things you can add to it. Um, and that makes it competitive to Squarespace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah. Well in, and you look at across the industry too, and it\'s like, I saw that email by the way, and I was like, I remember the days where you could.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hosting for that and try out your idea. Even if you\'re like, for me, it\'s like you said you had a couple domains sitting around, Well, I got way too many, but you know, you have an idea. Deploy it. See you can get it, get it going, but you\'re not, your [00:31:00] investment isn\'t big. Too big on that. And so I love that, uh, too.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. So I\'m curious, um, Getting down a little into WordPress too, cuz you\'ve seen a lot seen where it\'s gone and evolved is, you know, some of these big ones like Gutenberg, the code editor. Yep. Um, and I\'m curious, you know, the direction too of WordPress, uh, I, I don\'t like to say this, but in web terms, WordPress is ancient.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Like it\'s, it\'s code. That\'s what, 20 plus years here now we\'re talking about, you know, and you\'re like, but in web term it feels young still to me. But in web terms you\'re like all these new startups, some of this technology didn\'t exist when WordPress rolled out. Yep. But I\'m curious about your, your thoughts on the direct.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Of the platform too, and things like, I\'m gonna, I\'m gonna put in the buzzword, but it\'s a good buzzword, which is Gutenberg and the code editor and get your thoughts around that. And where, where direct, you know, how does it best WordPress best [00:32:00] position itself to continue to democratize the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> Yep. Um, yeah, it\'s a great question and, um, I think it, it bears a lot of challenge for the future growth.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, in, in, in my, in my opinion. I, it\'s a kind of, Not necessarily a very popular one, but, um, I think I, I would say that the, um, WordPress has succeeded cause, well it succeeded cuz it was open source in the first instance and yeah. As it has in beer, um, compared to, you know, your movable type competitors. But also it had this, it succeeded because of plug-ins and themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because of its ease of integration, because of the simplicity, because of the way that things held together. And it, uh, because it allowed people to create these sorts of websites that, um, you know, you could play around with and do it, it achieved critical mass really quickly from that, and it just grew, which is why it\'s gonna dominate that more complex website space forever, because it allows more complex websites and more playing.[00:33:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now Gutenberg, I don\'t know a great deal about Gutenberg, apart from the fact that I tried to make Guten. In 2014, I gave it a red hot Go. I was like, Okay, Squarespace, these drag and drop editors, these wicks web.com are actually really, really dangerous. Good platforms that have got a problem here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress has these wonderful themes that are out there like ims. Absolutely, and you know, and all of these other stuff, but none of the, All of these are developer friendly. All of these are short code functioning. All of these are requiring to do CSS and these things. We need a simple drag and drop suite, um, theme that, that anybody can use in a straightforward way, and we try.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I had a go, It was called upfront. Remember, we spent absolute fortune on it. I spent an absolute time on it and I discovered that. I\'m not talented enough. , and I think we were, we were, we, we didn\'t those us two [00:34:00] problems. The first was in terms of design and concept, we were fairly close. Like we were okay-ish.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We had some things and I look at Gutenberg now and I\'m like, Oh yeah, I remember that. That\'s, that\'s a really cool challenge. And this, I really like how they\'ve done that and it reminds me of very much of up front. And we had some really talented people working on it. Got Victor, who I used to work with, was like leading end.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It was really cool stuff. But we definitely didn\'t have the technical skills. We were nowhere near, like, we, we just couldn\'t, we just couldn\'t iron out the bugs. We couldn\'t put it together. We couldn\'t make it work seamlessly. There was too much, um, load on it. It was started in such way, didn\'t know how to project management, you know, It was just too hard.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we failed with it. Just a shame. And because it was, we had to go, we gave it a crack. And I see the same thing happening with Gutenberg because it, it looks like exactly the same things. My problem with Gutenberg, Isn\'t, um, isn\'t how it works or what it does. Cause I, I think it\'s really pretty cool. It\'s really interesting and I\'ve spent a lot of time, I have a lot of [00:35:00] amazing people working on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it\'s got a really good future. My problem with Gutenberg is it is baked into WordPress and the WordPress has succeeded because it\'s been an open place where you have a marketplace and a selection of people innovating and trying and creating new things. Themes, for example, across those different things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I have absolutely no doubt in my mind that element or divvy or whatever is coming after them. Those guys. Would, or perhaps, perhaps still will, who knows? But would be much better. Z berg vastly better, purely because of competition, because of range of, uh, people going at each other, because of financial incentives, because of capitalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Call it that, you know? Right. Um, it, it\'s, it\'s, and, and cause that\'s what\'s happened in WordPress since, um, and that\'s what\'s very WordPress. And so the baked in nature of Gutenberg, um, you [00:36:00] know, versus, you know, these other options is, um, and I think, you know, that\'s the, that\'s the problem. It\'s a bit sad, really.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I kind of, you know, it, it, it\'s, I, I, I wish it had just stayed as a theme that, you know, um, Maybe automatic could have made it a competitor to these things, you know? And they tried to grow it in the same way as they\'re doing jet pack and those things. And that\'s great. And I think, um, it would\'ve had a better chance as well because it would\'ve been pushed by other people in that competitive space and direction and just make it a purity commercial model rather than, this is the thing as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, as a commercial model, like the stuff I\'m doing, obviously WordPress is, is, is great and it\'s wonderful. And the open source community and the way that they work through it and the way that it\'s learned and matured is brilliant. And I. Everybody\'s on it with all my heart because I wouldn\'t have a business otherwise I wouldn\'t be able to do this stuff without them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'s absolutely brilliant. But cause I\'m a, I\'m a private company. I am, we are a private company. We don\'t have investors at share those sort of things here. We [00:37:00] can make decisions that are unpopular. Or that, um, that people don\'t like. We kill 90% of our plugins. You know, we, we, we can do things that you can\'t do in an open source community because like, well, you can do them, but everyone will leave or hate you or just have a huge palava and things there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I, I think innovation doesn\'t happen. That well in that environment. I think lots of great things do, but I think innovation happens when we are competing against each other and trying to do cool new things and get stuff out there. Yeah, I totally see that end ran .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> No, I totally see that. I think that\'s such a good perspective to share in, in the space in our ecosystem or community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, if you don\'t mind, uh, we were talking before and you\'re like, I, I think it should have stopped at this version. And I was like, What do you, what happened to that version? And would you share that too? Because I think</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> I, I think I said, I think I said that. Well, yeah. [00:38:00] Just before, I think I said that WordPress peaked at 0.72.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. , and I, I heard obviously WordPress now is vastly better than North 0.72, but, and, and I\'m not entirely sure. It\'s no 0.72, Please fact, check the hell outta me. Whoever\'s out there. But essentially as soon. As soon as, um, the, uh, integration, the seamless, beautiful, amazing integration of plugins and themes and the hooks and everything that allowed that to, it rolled into WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was the peak of WordPress innovation, and it was brilliant. And it has been led to all of these different things here. Um, and. Since then, WordPresses has not been revolutionizing things, It has not been transforming things interesting in the way that you talk about interesting Emberg name. Cause of course Emberg, you know, was a revolutionary technology.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t think it\'s a revolutionary theme or revolutionary, you know, way of processing or making things. Um, because I think that\'s when, that\'s when WordPress kind of peaked and with, [00:39:00] has just been kind of evolving since otherwise, um, whereas the innovation\'s been happening on the side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, so that that kind of times was a lot of the discussion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the product space, particularly with plugins around wordpress.org and things with our product members at post status. And I think that\'s so compelling to say too because I, I really appreciate there\'s a, in that, is that there, the ecosystem, the product ecosystem. We might have called them premium one day, but another commercial, whatever name we\'re gonna put on \'em.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But, um, and, and when this conversation came around that, around the active installs, um, data, you know, my first question was, and this is one I want to kinda ask you too, is our plugins, our plugins, themes, third party stuff, whether they\'re free, paid, whatever in between, essential to WordPress, Past and essential to WordPress future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so I\'m gonna submit that to you because I wanna hear your thoughts on that. I have [00:40:00] my own opinions, but I wanna hear</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> your . There\'s a lot of opinions aren\'t there, about the, um, the in-store thing? I, I, I have to admit, I\'ve been, uh, I\'ve been lurking quite actively in those discussions and yeah, we\'ve been having a few internal chats about it as well, because of course, it\'s important to us, you know, we want to know how well our or, or not, how well our plugins are doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, we, for example, we\'ve seen. Uh, SMASH recently, um, over the last year or so was one of our, our leading plugin. It\'s the big thing that, you know, people really like. Um, and actually started to lose, um, some market share to, um, some of our competitors like, uh, u and um, short Pixel and those things. And these are, these are fine plugins and they do great job and, you know, but I was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hang on. You know, I thought we were really good at this and we\'re doing this really well. Why are we losing this? And the reason we were, And so we looked into it, we did a huge amount of discovery and um, we, we found some things which we thought, Oh, okay, our bulk must limits too low. Okay. [00:41:00] Alright. Our background image optimization isn\'t working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re having to have people keep it over. Our new user experience for the first, like kind of five clicks, um, things. There isn\'t that. Compared to these guys. And so we dived into it and we worked our butts off to improve it. And we\'re rolling out improvements at the moment. And just, just as the, uh, the plugin active install growth stuff disappeared, we were back to level, like up from North Point one to North Percent and we were all cheering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were like, every week we\'d see it update on Sunday and we\'re like, Yes. You know, And it started to get towards positive territory. We\'re back baby, and. Yeah, it was, um, it was pretty gutting to kind of suddenly have it go and to not get that kind of feedback loop that we were doing good things and creating good things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, having said that,</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think the reason the most, the most the reason for the active installs being removed, which was [00:42:00] given in the track ticket or whatever things, there not enough obs. Not sufficiently obs. If I pronou, I can\'t remember. It\'s one of those words. I can never, I can never get out. No, not sufficiently hidden.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s say that, let\'s translate it to there. I think that\'s, um, a good reason to get rid of it. I think that, not to get rid of them to improve, I think that, um, I think that a good way to think about this is think about what the internet would be like if Google published their algorithm, like literally published it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, they, they will say, We do publish it. We\'ve got a page guidelines and 60 pages, 90 pages. I\'m. Yeah, that\'s good. And that\'s a guide and we go by that, and that\'s really helpful. But I wanna see the actual algorithm, the actual code that shows how you display these things here. I will tell you what will happen if that happened.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If that happened, the entire internet would be destroyed because it would be immediately dominated by a bunch of machine [00:43:00] learning bots going through Google\'s algorithm and spitting out things that matched it. The people who were able. When it updated the people who were able to more quickly respond. So this would be why.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'d be machine learning AI stuff and change their sites to fit into this new algorithm would be the winners. And so you would have an internet that was basically written by computers for computers and it would be absolutely rubbish. And that\'s why. Google don\'t publish one of the reasons, but that\'s a very, very good reason for Google not publishing its algorithm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the same is true for plugins and plugin pages and all of those different things. If we know exactly as a, as a business owner, if I know exactly how it is, I can get my plugin to rank above yo and get smarts. That position. Yes. Well, I\'m damn well gonna. And I\'m gonna do it hard, and I\'m gonna actually devote probably most of the resources of the company to figuring out how that happens and how we can quickly respond things there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then all that we\'re gonna get is a sea of plugins [00:44:00] with solitary purpose is to rank hires and yos and not immediately use a users once they install them, or at least get them to create an API key or give me a lead or do whatever it is, these sort of things. And that would not be good for WordPress or plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And essentially what they\'re saying is that the plug. Code for ranking the code for, you know, kind of making plugins, appearance things. There wasn\'t actually, it was a bit too obvious. And there are people out there who are a hell of a lot smarter than I am. Lots of, not very hard. There\'s lots of people out there, lots smart than I am who have essentially cracked the code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They\'ve figured out how to do it, and they\'re constantly cracking the code and they\'re constantly going through it. I think I remember, um, one, there was something about how many support tickets you had and how many support tickets you closed, and so people were creating support tickets for themselves, and then I swing them with somewhat general things and stuff and attaching it to the plugin, all sorts of sketchy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Happening left, right, and center. And [00:45:00] essentially, yeah, the, It was too obvious. It was too, there. People were gaming it and this was gonna produce a world of ship plugins that are basically existing in order to just climb the charts and do the machine learning thing. Now, what would\'ve been better would\'ve been if they\'d just improved the algorithm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Or made it to the point at which ally Google, you know, back in the day in 2002, you could game Google. You could SEO hack. Yep. You could do, You could do these things. You can\'t anymore. Right? You can. You can. I mean, there are bits and bobs, but you wouldn\'t want to because it\'s too dangerous. You might get caught.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And also it\'s just a bit too challenging and it\'s too clever in these thingss here. What would be great would be just, they just, they just improved that they just had a big ass project to improve the plug, the plugin algorithm, I don\'t care if it\'s open source community, I don\'t care if it automatic, writes every single part of that code and contains its proprie information and never lets anybody see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then that would enable those stats to stay in place. And that\'s my complaint. That\'s my complaint about it, is like, [00:46:00] Guys, you just pulled something. It was so bloody important and I know why you pulled it. It makes perfect sense why you pulled it. Like, couldn\'t you have just, you know, been done something better?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Could you have been smart enough to actually solve it in another way? And they, they say that they will, um, you know, this is, the intention is to come back with the bigger and better and things here, but like, man, was it, was it that bad? Was it that much of a problem that, Cause it wasn\'t, we weren\'t like machine, like I said, learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We were. We were checking out our onboarding process. We were reviewing our complaints by users. We were doing deep surveys. We were doing third party like kind of um, user testing.com, things where people actually log in and you watch them talking through the process and the problems we have to improve our stuff.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And now we are like, Oh know if this is working . And I\'m like, I mean like we could a shooting in the dark and that\'s the majority of people. And there might have been some people who were getting an advance and screwing around with it, but couldn\'t you have just spent the time to [00:47:00] improve the algo and then just switched it rather than dumping us on us, which feels horrible and draconian and alienates people, and stops me from improving smush like I\'d.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Yeah, and I go back to what you said, which is, you know, the, the what, the third part, you know, the plugins and themes out there have done is helped WordPress innovate and continue to say simple enough as a core, and then you extend as you need it for those complex things that you might have. And you know the question I ask.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It. I think, I hope when I say our plugins essential to WordPress is continued growth and health. I think that, I hope the answer is, uh, resounding heck yes. The second question that I think this particular issue illuminates is how do we continue to better support, and this is part of the role post status, is how do we continue to support plugin, the plugin ecosystem.[00:48:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, even better, you know? Mm-hmm. is take this as an opportunity to say this is essential. This is why WordPress has grown. It will continue to grow. Mm-hmm. , and it will continue to innovate. And then the question becomes, how do we continue to foster and grow the health and support of those vital plugin developers out there creating the next whatever thing it is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> Well, yeah, go ahead. I mean, I, I dunno, it, it\'s your business and I, I, I, you know, there are loads of different ways to do it. I didn\'t wanna straight off just answer it, but I, I think what you could do in this first instance is you could look at a community project, um, where people actually collect, um, plugin, um, install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And pool it so that you are able to have a bunch of people sharing data to say, This is how things are going, and this is how things are not going. I mean, if wordpress.org won\'t do it, then why don\'t we? Yeah, that\'s, that\'d be, that\'d be my thought.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Well, I [00:49:00] know we\'re, we\'ve run it over time actually, but I really appreciate this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe this\'ll be part two is where we dig into some of these things too. Cause I really wanted to, I think you got to, um, to share some of the things you\'re doing, but I wanted to talk about. Wmu and your future there and what you\'re planning. Um, but maybe that\'ll be part two. I know we\'ve kind of gone along, but James Farmer, thanks so much for this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think this was our teaser for part two, by the way, . Oh no, I\'d love to. Thank you. Uh, we gotta talk more often cuz uh, uh, we\'ve got a lot to talk about still, but, uh, James, thanks so much for being on the, uh, post status draft podcast and, uh, I appreciate your time and it\'s good catching up with you and hearing your story, sharing some of your thoughts too, I think are, are really critical for our ecosystem as a whole.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> thank you. Ah, it\'s, it\'s been a pleasure. Thank you for having me, Corey. You bet.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Thanks James Farmer. And by the way, tell, um, Wpm U Dev, uh, check out what they\'re doing. Um, cool stuff they\'ve got going on there. You got so many things going on that they, I can just say go [00:50:00] check it out. See what they\'re doing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>James Farmer:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. A we\'ve got a, yeah, we\'ve got a free level. People can play around with stuff as well, so give it a go. We didn\'t used to have a free level. It\'s a have fun, have a, have a, have a tweak.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Cory Miller:</strong> Will do. All right. Thanks everybody for being, uh, listening in and, uh, we\'ll be talking to James I\'m sure very soon.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 18:24:47 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Olivia Bisset\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:4;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:96:\"Do The Woo Community: Tumblr Showing Some Woo, Enterprise and Returning WooCommerce Office Hours\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73462\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:94:\"https://dothewoo.io/tumblr-showing-some-woo-enterprise-and-returning-woocommerce-office-hours/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:474:\"<p>Conversations about Woo running Tumblr payments, the WordPress enterprise space and return of WooCommerce Developer Office Hours.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/tumblr-showing-some-woo-enterprise-and-returning-woocommerce-office-hours/\">Tumblr Showing Some Woo, Enterprise and Returning WooCommerce Office Hours</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 11 Nov 2022 10:00:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:5;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:76:\"Post Status: WordPress 6.1.1 • FSE → Site Editor • Twenty Twenty Three\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=143044\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-6-1-1-fse-%e2%86%92-site-editor-twenty-twenty-three/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:15528:\"<h2 id=\"h-this-week-at-wordpress-org-november-7-2022\">This Week at WordPress.org (November 7, 2022)</h2>\n\n\n<div class=\"has-background has-theme-palette-8-background-color wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\">Get a look at the latest default theme, Twenty Twenty-Three!

Gutenberg lead architect Matías Ventura <a href=\"https://twitter.com/matias_ventura/status/1590278101053104128\">responded</a> with links to the roadmap for font management in core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In June, Automattic-sponsored core committer Tonya Mork organized a ticket for tracking the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41479\">ongoing roadmap for the Web fonts API</a>. It includes the vision for how the API supports typography features and the necessary tasks for creating a &#8220;font library.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This API&#8217;s job is to provide the backend capabilities to support the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41479#font-library\">&#8220;font library&#8221;</a> to include font management and dynamic building of the <code>@font-face</code> styles,&#8221; Mork said in the ticket. The purpose of the font library is to manage and catalogue fonts and provide users an interface for selecting fonts to use on their sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All fonts coming into WordPress would be &#8220;registered fonts&#8221; and would be available through the following methods:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>a theme bundling them</li>\n\n\n\n<li>a user uploading fonts they purchased</li>\n\n\n\n<li>a plugin registering them</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Mork highlighted a few risks the Font Library feature might introduce, which will need to be addressed during the development process.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There are potential performance risks such as enqueuing too many fonts,&#8221; she said. &#8220;A separate issue will consider impacts and propose adding a filterable throttle to limit the number that can be enqueued.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another risk outlined in the ticket includes the potential for plugins programmatically removing a theme&#8217;s fonts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;With <code>remove</code> being publicly exposed for consumption, a plugin could remove any or all of the theme&#8217;s font declarations and replace them with their own, i.e. without user interaction or awareness,&#8221; Mork said. &#8220;This could potentially create inconsistencies with typography UIs and previews.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The API is being developed to handle locally hosted web fonts out-of-the-box but would also provide the means for plugin authors to build methods for handling remotely hosted web fonts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Automattic-sponsored designer Joen Asmussen has also opened a <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45271\">ticket</a> exploring the possibilities for managing font sets in Global Styles → Typography. He created mockups for an interface for picking font sets (a primary font for headings and a secondary font for body text), as well as for managing the set properties. Users would also be able to manage font weights via a modal panel for the selected font.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>His designs suggest a basic interface for uploading fonts, accessed through the ellipsis menu:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/41479\">roadmap for the webfonts API</a> and the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/45271\">font management interface</a> tickets will be an exciting project to watch, as Gutenberg contributors work to offer another level of creative control to users. It&#8217;s still in the exploration phase, but the Font Library feature is intended to be built, refined, and stabilized over multiple WordPress releases as it materializes in the Site Editor.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 15:38:05 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:86:\"Do The Woo Community: WooCommerce Performance and Cloud-Based SaaS with Ivailo Hristov\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73451\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-performance-and-cloud-based-saas-with-ivailo-hristov/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:462:\"<p>We chat about NitroPacks history, WooCommerce and performance, choosing a cloud-based SaaS vs hosted and a last-minute Black Friday tip.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/woocommerce-performance-and-cloud-based-saas-with-ivailo-hristov/\">WooCommerce Performance and Cloud-Based SaaS with Ivailo Hristov</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 10 Nov 2022 10:58:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:8;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:117:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce 7.1 Adds Cart Block Cross-Sells, Includes High Performance Order Storage Behind a Feature Flag\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=139395\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:126:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-7-1-adds-cart-block-cross-sells-includes-high-performance-order-storage-behind-a-feature-flag\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2794:\"<p><a href=\"https://developer.woocommerce.com/2022/11/08/woocommerce-7-1-0-released/\">WooCommerce 7.1</a> was released yesterday, delivering on time with the highly anticipated <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-6-9-released-high-performance-order-storage-targeted-for-7-1\">custom order tables</a> feature, which was renamed to &#8220;High-Performance Order Storage&#8221; (HPOS). This is a major undertaking that implements custom tables for orders, products, and coupons, and promises significant performance gains for stores. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Contributors have been working on HPOS throughout 2022 but have been discussing its implementation for years.

My name is Nathan Wrigley. Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress. The people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes, and in this case, what the future looks like for WordPress developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, well I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Head over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today we have Fränk Klein. Fränk is a self-taught developer. He started out learning PHP in 2011, and from there found his way to WordPress. Over the years he&#8217;s worked for Automattic at wordpress.com, and WordPress VIP, and is now a principal developer at Human Made, an enterprise WordPress agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today on the podcast we talk about how Fränk decided early on that he was going to start developing with blocks and, more recently, with the full site editing capabilities now built into WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the four phases of the Gutenberg project, content editing, site customization, collaborative editing and multi-lingual, and where full site editing fits into this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk explains how he sees the adoption of Gutenberg as inevitable. WordPress is moving away from the classic approach of content creation, to a more visual, block based experience. He thinks that it&#8217;s important to become an expert at building websites and custom solutions for clients, and for taking the time to learn the new tools that this future will require.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He&#8217;s not suggesting that the journey towards expertise in React and JavaScript will be easy, but he does see it as essential for those wishing to continue to use WordPress as their CMS of choice. He also makes the point that now is a great time to invest in yourself as there are more resources than ever, which can assist you in this learning path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you&#8217;ll hear, Fränk is all in on WordPress, and is very optimistic about the future for experienced WordPress developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast, and you&#8217;ll find the other episodes there as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so, without further delay, I bring you, Fränk Klein.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Fränk Klein. Hello Fränk.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:34] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Hey there. How you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:35] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m very well, thank you. It&#8217;s very nice to have you on the podcast. We typically at the beginning of the podcast orientate the listeners by asking a very basic and simple question just to tell us who you are, what your relationship is with WordPress, how long you&#8217;ve been working in the space, possibly the company that you now work for, and all of that goodness. So, Fränk, it&#8217;s over to you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:03:54] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> So my name is Fränk Klein. I live in Luxembourg in the heart of Europe, and I got started with WordPress in 2011. So that&#8217;s when I started programming. So the background is that I&#8217;m actually a print designer, which at that time, wasn&#8217;t really that much of a bright career path. So I switched to programming, bought myself a PHP book, and then discover WordPress, and that&#8217;s been my passion ever since.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, I kind of have a varied background because I was in a small agency, still in Luxembourg. Worked for Automattic as part of the wordpress.com theme team. I worked at WordPress VIP, and then now I&#8217;m at Human Made, which is an enterprise WordPress agency where I&#8217;m a principal engineer. And so as part of that is my passion has been WordPress, but I also have a big interest in the wider web ecosystem, and so that&#8217;s why there is my interest in everything block related.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:51] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, and that&#8217;s going to be the basis of our conversation today. So Fränk&#8217;s here to talk about Gutenberg in general, but more specifically about full site editing. And I think probably a good way to begin the conversation to, again, provide a bit of orientation, is just to run through the history of the Gutenberg project and now full site editing. So I don&#8217;t know if you are willing to do that. Run through the history of when it all began and what the phases are and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:17] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Yeah, so, I think when we talk about full site editing, we cannot forget the wider picture, and that is that full site editing is part of the Gutenberg project, which Matt Mullenweg, the WordPress lead started back in 2017. And the idea behind Gutenberg was really that WordPress ran its course in the way that it was at that time, in that there needed to be a ground up reimagining of a lot of the core components that make up WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So therefore, there are four phases. The first one is content editing. So that was in 2018 when WordPress 5.0 introduced the block editor, or the content editor how I prefer to call it. Then the next step is site customization. Part of it was in 5.8, but most people will know it from 5.9 when full site editing was introduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then the next phase, which they are starting right now is collaborative editing. So Google Doc style editing of different people on the same content. And then there will be multilingual. So that&#8217;s the big picture of the Gutenberg project. And so, full site editing is just part of this. And so the thing about these phases is that the content editing phase that was, by now four years ago, but it&#8217;s not really finished because the content editing experience still gets upgrades. It gets stuff added to it. And so that&#8217;s how this project is laid out. And even if we now roll into the collaboration full site editing isn&#8217;t done, and they will continue to work on it for the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:43] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> If we were to roll back the clock prior to Gutenberg, so let&#8217;s say, 2015 or something like that, and there were people at that point who were using just the classic editor, they were maybe putting just content in or short codes and page builders and so on, came along. What do you think was the point of having all of this in core?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, it could be left to third parties, it could be plugins or it could be themes that took on the job of the way that your site was presented. What is the promise? Deep down, what&#8217;s the sort of kernel of Gutenberg? What is it offering? Where are we headed with it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:07:18] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> This is kind of where the, the bigger picture comes in because, when we just talk about full site editing, it&#8217;s called the site customization phase. It&#8217;s not called page building phase. It&#8217;s not called theme building phase. Those are all things that you can do with full site editing. But really the idea behind full site editing is, there was the customizer, right? So that was the way that you interact with your theme, and that didn&#8217;t work out. I think the promise that the customizer had in the beginning didn&#8217;t pan out to be what people wanted to be. And so then the idea was that we have something better, which is built up on this concept of blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so the thing that makes full site editing and then, the customizer very different is that, the customizer, the idea was there was this tool and there are only minimal controls available, and if you want to have your own, there are just APIs and a builder. And so the problem was that everybody built their own controls, and then there was other confusion for users, and themes weren&#8217;t compatible with each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the site editor, or just say the Gutenberg project in general takes a very different approach, in that it says, we&#8217;re going to give you a lot of customization options, controlling fonts, controlling colors. And beyond those options, this is like the full menu of everything you can do, we give you the APIs to preset these things, to remove them, to customize them. And so the bigger context here is that this is a customers replacement for the moment, but it also allows you to build new templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And the idea is that many of the menus that we have in the WordPress admin are going to be rolled into the site editor. So for example, reading, settings, things like that. There are definitely concepts already exploring how that could be part of the site editor. So really, when we talk about even collaborative editing, that&#8217;s going to require changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Multilingual is going to require changes. That all is just wrote into this Gutenberg project, of which full site editing is one part. The promise is kind of that based on this concept of blocks, we are going to be able to reimagine how people interact with WordPress, both as users and also as developers. And it&#8217;s going to be done much more through visual interfaces that are a lot easier to understand and to work with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that way really we&#8217;re going from the old word of WordPress to the new WordPress, which is then going to be able to be around for a decade or more. So that&#8217;s the big picture vision behind the whole project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:48] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, sort of future proofing if you like. Given all of that, let&#8217;s just put the conversation about blocks to one side and about what they offer, we can come back to that in a few moments. I want to talk just for a moment about how it is that such a large proportion of the community, and when I say large proportion I don&#8217;t really have any figures. Not claiming it&#8217;s 10, 20, 50, 70, whatever. Percent, but there&#8217;s been a certain amount of people within the WordPress community who have not got such an optimistic approach to full site editing and the Gutenberg project more broadly. In many cases, they don&#8217;t really want to have much to do with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They&#8217;re happy with the tools that they&#8217;ve got, and they&#8217;re happy with the systems that they&#8217;ve got in place, whether that be a page builder or whatever it is. I&#8217;m just wondering if you have any thoughts on how the communication went, introducing Gutenberg and full site editing. Do you think that the promise was explained from the beginning? Maybe the promise wasn&#8217;t fully realized. Or do you think that there were some PR missteps along the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:10:49] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Well, yeah. There&#8217;s several parts of it. I think that when Matt introduced it, he wrote this post called we called it Gutenberg for a reason, and that very much painted a broad picture. In my opinion it went a little bit overboard comparing it to the invention of the printing press. It&#8217;s just my personal sentiment about it, that&#8217;s maybe overdoing it by a lot. But he definitely had this vision where he explained what problems this project was trying to solve.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that was around for a bit. And then we went right into the details. So the block editor was introduced, all these APIs, and so at that point we just focus very much on the what, and not the why. Why is this there? And instead of just saying, hey, here&#8217;s this paragraph block, and it works this way. There never was really a step taken back in where there was an exploration of, here are these tools and these are all the possibilities that you now have with these tools.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And to adapt that to the different profiles that we have in the WordPress space, because we have end users, we have power users, we have theme developers, plugin developers. And kind of this translation from the nitty gritty to the bigger picture and also let&#8217;s say the potential that is there, because there definitely is a lot of potential. That was missed, unfortunately, and I think that&#8217;s why, if all you just see is a bunch of stuff getting thrown in your face and nobody really explains to you what you&#8217;re supposed to do with it, and why they&#8217;re adding all it. Then unfortunately that&#8217;s, I think the situation where we were in where just a large part of the community didn&#8217;t see the point. And so the project is doing a lot more of trying to fix these mistakes. So they are a lot better about showcasing the things that you can do. So I&#8217;m very hopeful in that, that we&#8217;ll get to those bigger picture conversations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:37] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess, for me at least, when Gutenberg rolled into Core, it came with some default blocks, which you could use. But they very much were the kind of things that you could have done and could have achieved in all the previous versions of WordPress. So you could put in a paragraph and whilst you could move that paragraph independently, it was still a paragraph. And so not tremendously exciting. And the same with images. You&#8217;ve always been able to do something similar to that. I&#8217;m just wondering if there was a wow moment that got missed there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In other words, when that came into Core, right at the beginning, if some bizarre, let&#8217;s use that word, some bizarre, extraordinarily clever block could have been shipped, just to give everybody that aha moment. But it didn&#8217;t happen that way. We just got a fairly ordinary pallet of blocks to choose from. And so people perhaps got disinterested and never came back. And now we&#8217;re in the process of trying to show people what those aha moments are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And certainly from my point of view, I&#8217;ve. Implementation&#8217;s left, right and center of really incredibly difficult and complicated things built inside a really small, tiny UI in the block editor, and it is amazing. But I, I do wonder if that moment was missed and it&#8217;ll be difficult to ever get that excitement back?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:52] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Well, I think there are two parts with it. I think that one might discuss the point at which the block editor was introduced. So for sure, in the beginning it was a bit rough. And so if already having trouble to have the time to find polish, to polish this product, they probably didn&#8217;t have the time to build a lot of showcasing tools because they were just trying to get this done to include it into Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay, this was the situation and it is how it is. They could at least showcase the potential of in, blog posts after the release. But I think the big opportunity that was lost is just to look at the ecosystem and just to go out to agencies, product companies, whatever, that were using blocks and to take the things that these people were building and then to show it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think that&#8217;s a big missed opportunity. Just a case study. This was the problem and this is the solution that was developed, and this is the reason why it was developed. And these are the outcomes. Right, so talking much more in business language, not really in they used this API and that API, which might change and which is really not interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There was a lot missed on that. I know we have the state of the world and then there is a maybe three second slide for some project which was super impressive. But all it gets is this three seconds in the presentation. Frankly speaking all people don&#8217;t even watch. So I think that was a big opportunity which got missed.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:12] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> In your learning about the construction of blocks and all of the different technological pieces that you had to acquire along that road. How difficult has that journey been for you? So, Let&#8217;s say, for example, there&#8217;s somebody listening to this, and by the end of this they are indeed convinced that this is the way to go. What&#8217;s the learning path like? Did you find that to be a fairly difficult experience? Was there a lot to learn that meant that you couldn&#8217;t progress until you&#8217;d got over several hums? Was it easy, was it hard? What was it like?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:39] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Well, I was lucky enough to already know, let&#8217;s say modern JavaScript in quotes and React, before I start with blocks. So that&#8217;s definitely a big hump to get over if you are coming from a traditional PHP background and you, you know, maybe write jQuery, some of it, but, uh, you don&#8217;t really have a lot of JavaScript affinity. That&#8217;s actually one big issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just building the blocks was rough when I did it, because it was so early. I think the first project that I did, it was still with the Gutenberg plugin, like it was before 5.0. But I think that at this point it&#8217;s a lot easier. It&#8217;s just that the documentation has got a lot better. There are tons of material for people to learn this. But over time my thinking has shifted on that, because if you would know how to build a block, like technically speaking, that&#8217;s good, but this is really just the base level. The challenge really is to, how do I design all the experiences for my users, my end users, so that they fit into this paradigm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can have a custom blocks that works, that&#8217;s entirely PHP rendered. You might have JavaScript run in the editor. You might add a plugin to the editor. You might have a custom control. You might have customizations of core blocks. And that&#8217;s really knowing all of these tools that are available and when to use them, how to use them. That&#8217;s really the difficult part.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That being said, I think that, for me it&#8217;s always, even when it&#8217;s difficult, I kind of have the opinion of this is why I get paid. I get paid to solve the hard issues. And so if there is a hump to get over, I am, I&#8217;m ready to do it. But I think just in the wider picture, you need to just start doing it, and just keep doing it, even if it&#8217;s frustrating, because that&#8217;s just how it is with anything. If you try and learn the guitar, I&#8217;m going to tell you it&#8217;s not going to be easy. But you just need to keep with it. And then over time this will just become second nature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because that&#8217;s also the question, you know, it&#8217;s the chicken and egg problem somewhat, is well, how do I become a JavaScript developer? Well you write a lot of JavaScript. You know, honestly, that&#8217;s how easy it is. It&#8217;s just like doing pushups. You wanna be good at doing pushups, you need to do a lot of pushups. That&#8217;s pretty much the solution. And once you accept that there is no magic solution that will just come down and allow you to continue to write PHP, and take advantage of all of these new opportunities. That doesn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I know a few projects out there say that you can write PHP and you will have will all of the capabilities to build blocks, but that&#8217;s definitely not the case. So it&#8217;s just a matter of taking the decision to learn it and then sticking with it. But I have a actually a tutoring program for building blocks. All it takes is six weeks, but it&#8217;s going to be intense, six weeks. But after that you know the basics. Then we can move on to the more important things, which are the experiences that you should build for your end users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:27] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I will definitely link in the show notes to your WPdevelopment.courses website, where you can go and check out what Fränk&#8217;s got on offer there and, the six week program. I think there&#8217;s a couple different things on the website, but we&#8217;ll definitely link to that. But do you feel sanguine now that there&#8217;s more information out there that, it is now possible? And in the day when you were doing it, it was probably more of a slog than it is now. Where do you turn to when you&#8217;ve got problems? Is it colleagues? Do you turn to friends, relations? Who are you looking towards when you are trying to solve the problems in your own work?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:00] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Colleagues, so I&#8217;m very lucky to have a lot of colleagues that are a lot better than I am in different things. And that&#8217;s really the magic of being in a larger company. I know that if I struggle with this piece, I go to this person. If I struggle with that thing, I go to this other person.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m very lucky with that. That being said a lot of the problems that I encounter very much also React or JavaScript problems, so there&#8217;s always the wider ecosystem for that. I do think though that even if you are alone and all you have is just the official documentation, it is entirely possible to learn this. And I&#8217;m very upfront with, when I have a program or a course, I&#8217;m just selling you a time saver. I&#8217;m saving you time and frustration, but you definitely could do it with just the default stuff that is out there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that the WordPress learn website, they&#8217;re adding more and more stuff to it. Of course, it&#8217;s not as polished as something which is really starting to end a learning path. That&#8217;s just the downside of this being free documentation. But it is definitely possible to learn. And especially when we talk about just the people that want to get maybe deeper into JavaScript and React. There&#8217;s a ton of courses out there where people teach you that stuff, which are great and not very expensive.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think the difference between, when we got started, 5.0 and now, it&#8217;s night and day. It&#8217;s not even comparable how much easier it is to learn blocks right now. And, we mustn&#8217;t forget that. I see it every day, inside of Human Made and also in community. There are people learning it from all kinds of backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Even people that would say that they aren&#8217;t really developers. So it&#8217;s not like there is some secret source or something that you need to be born with to learn. This is very achievable. But again, you need to put in the work and the time to achieve it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, achievable, but there will be some element of struggle along the way. But it&#8217;s nice to know that there are options out there. And you mentioned Learn, and like I said, we&#8217;ll link to the bits and pieces that you provide as well. You are clearly very into all of this. This is something that you&#8217;ve staked your future on, I guess to some extent. You&#8217;ve learned all of these skills and how do you feel about the broader picture for people in the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So agencies, freelancers, and what have you, who have yet to embark on this journey and are still doing things in the way that they have been doing. Do you see that the future for them is going to be more difficult in the work that you do? Do you see that the potential is paying off? Are clients coming to you and you are able to build things more quickly, potentially have a user interface which they like more, and so on? I just wondered what your thoughts were about the future for freelancers, agencies, and and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:21:33] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> I think that when we talk about the work that I do, we have the chance to work with bigger budgets, so that gives us a lot more, let&#8217;s say free space to build out certain things. But, the thing inside Human Made is that Human Made hasn&#8217;t built a website without blocks ever since the block editor got introduced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That was just the default, because we saw the problems that this was solving. Because the classic editor, for our clients, even the clients in the publishing industry, like it didn&#8217;t work. We were having solutions to deal with certain issues, the workarounds that we all knew, but these were just not up to the task. And so when we saw the block editor, not only what was there in terms of the starting blocks, which is paragraph and image, which wasn&#8217;t very exciting, but the whole framework surrounding it to build a custom blocks we said, okay, these and these, and these are going to be the problems that we can solve with this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it&#8217;s going to take us a lot less time. It&#8217;s going to be more efficient because we can reuse certain things a lot easier. And also it&#8217;s going to be a lot better experience for the end users. And the thing that we need to understand is that, as I alluded to in the beginning, full site editing is just one part of the bigger picture.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can say, maybe I don&#8217;t want to use this part of full site editing, or I don&#8217;t want to use that part. And that is fine because we are in a transitionary phase, where we are transitioning really from a very classic theme development approach to this new paradigm of building themes. But if it just flat out say, I don&#8217;t want to use blocks at all, never ever, then probably, at least as I see it, then you&#8217;re going to need to stop using WebPress at one point or another. Which is fine because I think a lot of the careers in WordPress are incidental in that people just found WordPress and then they started using it, but there was, for most, not a point where they said, this is really WordPress and this is why I use it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so WordPress is just a tool, if at a certain point a tool doesn&#8217;t work for you, then choose something else. I think that&#8217;s just something where you need to be honest with yourself. The other part is that when we think about what an agency is, if you choose WordPress because you say this is the best solution for us, then you need to be all in with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can&#8217;t really say, I&#8217;m going to choose WordPress, but not these and these parts of WordPress, which I don&#8217;t like, which are just key to experience. And how content is edited and how themes are built, that&#8217;s a very key part of the CMS. So you can&#8217;t just ignore those. But the difficulty is, what I alluded to before, is that you need to really understand how a block theme works, how the site editor works, how I guess the end goal works.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then once you have understood what that experience is, then you can come back and say, well at this point, for this project, I don&#8217;t want to have full on block templates. I&#8217;m going to use more hybrid approach where maybe the users can change this part or that part to the editor. And that&#8217;s all fine because you are making a very conscious decision of choosing features that fit best with that specific project.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But you know what the possibilities are, and you know what to pick next, once you get over that initial phase where we just build partial websites. For example, landing pages are something which you can already build now with blocks and you could for a while. Now it&#8217;s just a lot easier to do. So it really depends a lot on your specific use case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And for that, if your work is building websites with WordPress, you need to have the experience of making the right choices. So if you&#8217;re just pushing the point at which you do the switch in the future and into the future, into the future, there&#8217;s going to be a time at which somebody comes in an agency that says, well we have been building with this since 2018, and you only started in 2024 for some reason.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s a lot of time and a lot of experience that you&#8217;re missing out on. So it&#8217;s just like with building blocks. You have to jump into the pool, and wobble around with your legs and arms and try to swim. And you will see, it gets easier and easier. But, I think what we need to just understand that, WordPress has been the same for so long, and we think that&#8217;s normal, but it&#8217;s definitely not. Because the wider web development space has changed so dramatically just in the last five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we cannot expect to keep the same solutions that we&#8217;ve built always with meta boxes and what have you, and then expect this to be a solution which is competitive in two years, in five years. It&#8217;s not going to be the case. The world is moving on whether we want it or not, and we just need to get onto the train if we want to be a part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:03] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Couple of questions from that. The first one is you mentioned that there&#8217;s a competitive edge to be had here. I&#8217;m just wondering if you can give us some sort of insight into that. I realize you can&#8217;t talk about particular clients or anything like that, but what do you feel the advantage is that you can offer to clients? Are there conversations that you can have where the full site editing picture, the Gutenberg picture, the blocks picture, you can explain that promise to the clients, and you believe that they are persuaded by that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:31] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Well, I think that there are a couple of things. You need to start somewhere. I started early when it was still in the plugin and my colleagues at Human Made weren&#8217;t far behind. And so the thing is always that when the first project, we kind of had to convince the client, but not really, because we showed them the editor and it was like miles better what they had.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They say, Oh yeah, you know, we definitely like this with visual previews, because I mean it wasn&#8217;t even up to the classic editor, what they had before. So that was an easy win to be honest. And maybe that was luck, but. Then when the next client comes around and they ask what&#8217;s with this new editor thing? And we&#8217;re like, oh yeah, we did this project for this client and these are the custom blocks that we built, these are the problems which we solved. That&#8217;s an easier conversation because it doesn&#8217;t feel super outlandish to them anymore because, well this client did it, then, it seems a good solution, then why shouldn&#8217;t we do it?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so you need to build up that repertoire of just social proof to be honest. And so when a new client comes around and we having these sales talk, and they are explaining a problem to you. I can always say, we had this client, they had this problem, we built this solution. And so, when you just not only explain it to them, also show it to them, which we like, you know, we like to demo stuff. Then they definitely see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we are not even talking about this is a block and this is an extension of this default control because the client doesn&#8217;t care. They don&#8217;t know what is in Core and what isn&#8217;t. If it&#8217;s custom not. If it takes you an hour to do all week, you know, in a sense, they don&#8217;t care. They just want to have a solution that fits their needs. That&#8217;s just the competitive advantage of really knowing this thing very well. Which is why I said, if you don&#8217;t understand what full site editing is trying to do, you cannot really apply pieces of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The other part is of course, that maybe you are reluctant to learn JavaScript and React, but honestly it&#8217;s a very good thing to know, because if you ever were to get out of WordPress, a JavaScript developer, React developer, tons of jobs available. That&#8217;s also for me, when I look at my personal career, I always need to prepare for the case when WordPress might disappear overnight, for whatever freakish reasons. Then I&#8217;ll be fine. I just go and do a JavaScript, which I also enjoy. But I think that&#8217;s something which maybe a lot of people are missing it or they don&#8217;t want to think about it that much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the run of the mill WordPress developer with just a non WordPress development skills, is quite far behind the larger web development ecosystem. And that is fine if you say well, I&#8217;m not really a developer, just, maybe I&#8217;m a marketer, salesperson and I just build websites because I need one. But that&#8217;s not really what my core skill is.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you say well, I&#8217;m a developer and I build custom solutions for my clients, that&#8217;s really, my core skill is what I sell to my clients, and you are not able to work with what has been in WordPress for by now four years, custom blocks and this whole system that has been introduced. That&#8217;s not a great situation to be in.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So unless you want to be tied to a specific page builder, theme, and you want your stake, your fortune to the fortune of that company, then this is something which you just have to get with because, it&#8217;s very important for your own career and it&#8217;s very important for your own business. If you want to stay around for the next couple of years, this is not something that you should be sleeping on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:39] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, it&#8217;s interesting. I feel that there&#8217;s probably quite a lot of people who are fearful of some of the things that you mentioned. Learning React and learning JavaScript deeply, and they&#8217;re struggling just to use the time that they&#8217;ve got to output the work that they need to output to make ends meet. And so all of this extra, that they&#8217;ve suddenly got to learn becomes a little bit daunting. But it&#8217;s nice to hear that you feel at least that there&#8217;s opportunities there and perhaps in your imagination at least anyway, the window of opportunity is bigger, looking forwards with full site editing. And it&#8217;s closing with the old way that things have been done with PHP and themes and all of that kind of stuff. So that&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You kept saying the word custom solutions which I found curious. I&#8217;m guessing that on the enterprise level, the kind of clients that you are dealing with, that is the kind of work that you are involved with. You know, they come to you with websites which have a heavy burden of, it needs to be very custom. It&#8217;s got to be exactly what we want. The budget can accommodate that, and so you can really spend time drilling down. And so your knowledge of what&#8217;s possible with blocks and so on and so forth can really assist them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, you might have a block for some very specific task within the broader website, that you can build and there&#8217;s time and what have you for all of that. Whereas, I would imagine quite a lot of people listening to this, they really aren&#8217;t going to be doing that. It&#8217;s just a simple website. It&#8217;s a brochure website, four or five pages and that&#8217;s kind of it. And maybe they feel that they still don&#8217;t need it. But, anyway the custom solution piece I think is interesting. Can you talk to us about that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:09] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Ah, yeah, sure. I just wanna take the opportunity to circle back a bit to finding the time. And this comes from Brian Gardner, so thank you, Brian. He said there&#8217;s is five for the future, which WordPress says you should invest this time into the project so that it can sustain itself. And he proposes these five for your future, which just means well take 5% of your time and invest it into learning because that&#8217;s going to make it possible for you to have a sustainable future.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think that&#8217;s a very important concept. Cause I definitely do understand the need to make money and stay up to date on all of these things, and it&#8217;s not different when you are in an enterprise agency as when you are in a small agency. I mean, the struggle is always the same. I mean, everybody needs to make money, and the way to make money is to produce work for your clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think just if you are aware of the fact that you need to stay up to date, and you make it a priority. It&#8217;s the same as with any other thing in your business. It&#8217;s like accounting, everybody needs accounting and you can just not do it. And at some, you&#8217;re going to be screwed or you say, yes, I need to do my accounting and I need to take the time it takes to do it right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I mean, everybody needs time to write their invoices. And so people make time for that. And if you make this the same level of urgency and importance as writing invoice so you get paid, then learning is just going to be a natural part of that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s a piece of learning where you just need to get the basics, but then there&#8217;s a lot of learning on the job where you run into an issue and you figure it out and then you work some more, you run into another issue. So a lot of learning that you&#8217;re going to do is pretty much on the job. So that&#8217;s how it was for me. And to come back to the question of custom solutions. In general, when we talk about a website project where they cost $5,000 or $500,000, the challenge is always the same. There are certain pieces in the website that you need to have, so there needs to be navigation, there needs to be a list of content, posts. All these things are there, and it&#8217;s the same whether it&#8217;s small budget or big budget.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The challenge is what do you focus your energy on in that budget? And so that&#8217;s a conversation which we have with our clients where, for example, it&#8217;s a stupid thing, but we get the mock up, right? And there is this pagination on the bottom. And this pagination kind of looks tricky. I would say, look, that pagination, if we build it that way, it&#8217;s going to take us like a day to build it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And honestly, nobody cares what your pagination look like. We can switch it out with just the full pagination. We got all the functionality. It doesn&#8217;t look the same, but who cares about the pagination? And most clients, if we don&#8217;t say it that way, if they say little bit more nicely, most clients will be like, yeah, okay, understand, the pagination. because for them, they didn&#8217;t even see the pagination, right? It just slipped their mind. And so there&#8217;s this negotiation where you need to take all of the pieces which you can simplify and use something which is pre-done, that you do this way. And then you really have the time to focus on the pieces that are important to your client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Because I always talk the language of money. What makes you money? How do you make money? How can we help you make money? And that is the point where you&#8217;re going to invest a lot of your energy, and that is where the custom solutions come in. So we had a client that problem was that. They had a CMS, and it took their editors 25 minutes to just enter the content into the CMS because it was so complicated. They need to manually resize images, all of that. So we just took WordPress. We did some custom work, not a lot to be honest, just for that specific piece. And we brought it down to five minutes. At top, takes them five minutes to get an article entered into the system, published on the website, has all of the metadata for social media and everything like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that&#8217;s a case where you can present to a client how you make them a lot of money by saving them time, because they still have the same editors, but the output is a lot bigger. The important thing is to not be tied to things that you think should be custom, because let&#8217;s say a menu, a main navigation. Do you need a custom menu with all this and that, or can it just be dropdowns? Normal dropdowns. It&#8217;s a question. Maybe the answer is no, because you have, I don&#8217;t know, an e-commerce website and you need to have a more complicated menu. Or the answer is just yes. Just a menu, as we all know, is going to be fine.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that&#8217;s really the struggle that you find the things that you can standardize and WordPress is going to help you with that. Because a lot of the things that we needed custom solutions before now are standardized, or at least the way that you build it is standardized. So custom blocks are really difficult to build.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, a bunch of stuff is already there. A lot of components are there. And the challenge is that when we talk about the smaller budgets, the $5,000 project&#8217;s not going to go away, what you need to deliver for that amount, that&#8217;s going to go up. And so here, when we talk about full site editing, since a lot of the pieces already predone for you, you can assemble these pieces, you can customize them, and that will allow you to build a solution which corresponds to the needs of your clients. And it doesn&#8217;t take you a lot of time to do it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s the big idea behind is that, previously WordPress was very much, I give you these APIs, but there wasn&#8217;t really much in there. So now it&#8217;s completely different way. There&#8217;s a ton of stuff in there, but you need to really curate the experience that fits for your client and then you add the stuff that is not by default in there onto that. If it&#8217;s a plugin that you can use, great. We use tons of plugins at Human Made that just do things that we always do. And if it&#8217;s really a custom piece, then that&#8217;s where you write the custom code. And so through combinations of these factors, you&#8217;re going to be able to achieve the results for your clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:42] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I do like the piece that you mentioned there about having the client suddenly realized, that must have been a real aha moment. Something previously took 25 minutes. So if you did that twice, you&#8217;re approaching an hour to do, whatever that task was twice. And with the custom solution that you built, perhaps that was a block with the fields arranged differently, I don&#8217;t know. But the principle that could enter the same amount of data, you could do that twice in 10 minutes, you really have sold it I think at that point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Nobody&#8217;s going to deny that&#8217;s a better experience. And if it can, in the background, be doing things like creating the images and creating all of the metadata that goes with those images for the different social networks and so on and so forth. All of that stuff can be built inside of this custom solution. Yeah that&#8217;s fabulous. Like you said, the budget may not allow for it, in which case there&#8217;s still going to be a, the $5,000 website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I do think you are right as well that the expectation for what that $5,000 will buy you is only going to go up. It&#8217;s going to continue to be, $5,000 this year will get you this amount of functionality. And now that people are building with custom blocks and what have you, I imagine customers are going to be able to determine for themselves that, well, actually, no, for my $5,000 I&#8217;m expecting there to be a lot more on the back end that I can play with and for it to be customized just for my use case exactly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:56] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Right, and I think that, when we think about a traditional website project, there&#8217;s this waterfall model where development is at the very end. And if you approach it this way, you&#8217;re kind of ready, all of these decisions have been pre-made for you because, there is this custom pagination, I don&#8217;t know, but pagination is one of my pet peeves, so there&#8217;s this super expensive pagination, this weird menu, like stuff is all over the place. But those are the mockups that the client said, we&#8217;re going to build this, and now you are having to deal with the task of, okay, how I&#8217;m going to build this, in this amount of time? And then we just are at the same starting point where everybody else is, like, we have a website that pretty much looks like all other websites, because usually, unless the design is very expensive, it&#8217;s pretty much going to look like a lot of other stuff, obviously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so If you think of yourself as an engineer, you know, maybe that&#8217;s your title, but that&#8217;s not really what you are. You need to come in very early in the process and then already talk to the client in the very beginning, in the discovery phase, and find out what the pain points are and then try and make a note of these and also come out with a few possible solutions that you might deploy to do this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then you go in and you need to collaborate with the graphic designers. I need to collaborate with the client on how you put this website together. So since we now have a framework, which is WordPress, where we have all of those pieces to build a website. We need to be involved a lot earlier and also explain to designers what these pieces are. How far it can be customized and all of this. Because the approach as we did, by now maybe 15 years ago, where really we sold websites by the . Page and it was this mockup and that mockup, and that was how websites were sold, right, by the page. You paid this much per page. That is just gone. Now we need to build up these small pieces and we assemble them into bigger pieces and bigger pieces, and that&#8217;s how we build out the whole website from the small components.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That is both the case in terms of the design. So we start with the button, which is done part of a larger pattern, which is then part of the whole page design, or a call out box, whatever. You build up the design out this way, but it&#8217;s also the functionality. And a lot of the functionality that you build out, you&#8217;re going to have to deal with the data.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How do I model the data? How is it stored in the database? How does it get accessed? How do I store it in way that is all performant? And so, you as an engineer, you kind of need to talk the language, both of the client and the designers. And still know all of the background of what you need to do when it comes time to write code.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Cause let&#8217;s not kid ourselves, at a certain moment, you&#8217;re going to need to open that editor and start writing out code. Even when you&#8217;re dealing with, you know, full site editing. Then at that point you have everything lined up in the way that you can deliver the results that the client wants, within the time, and then also the budget that they have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s really the big challenge, and it&#8217;s going to require us to step away from a lot of that old waterfall thinking because, really when you have projects that I tend to do tend to be quite long. You know, sometimes three months, six months, a year. So if you have a project that runs a year, you&#8217;re not going to come in with a list of all the stuff that you&#8217;re going to do in a year.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s a constant, discovery, negotiation, building stuff. But at each point you are building something which already has value. And so if at the end of the project the budget runs out, and maybe we missed a few nice to haves, the client&#8217;s not going to, they&#8217;re not going to care, because they&#8217;ve got everything which they wanted and which is producing the results for them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s really the idea that we need to take forward. And to be honest, I don&#8217;t have all the answers on that. It&#8217;s just, I think that a more iterative approach where you build out pieces one by one in order of priority, and we have something which is working, which is going to produce results at any point. That&#8217;s the way that we&#8217;re going to do it, and it&#8217;s a lot easier to do that, just assemble pieces and then you add your little custom stuff to it. If you just start everything from scratch and it already takes you three days to come up with, you know, the basic site layout, I think that&#8217;s just outdated.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:41:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Interesting. So it almost feels like you are using bricks to build a wall. You might substitute the word bricks for blocks, which is a nice metaphor. Just before we end, it sounds like you&#8217;ve decided that this is the way that you&#8217;re going to do things in the future. You&#8217;re fully into this. The promise with new technology is always, we&#8217;re going to make your life easier. I do wonder, and maybe you can speak to this, have you simply swapped a bunch of problems that you used to have, for a new set of problems that you now have? So whilst in the past you were wrangling with different things, templates and themes and so on and so forth, you&#8217;re now just wrangling with a different set of problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What I&#8217;m trying to say is, is your job easier now, harder, or just the same?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:42:42] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> It&#8217;s the same, but it&#8217;s not. I think that we shouldn&#8217;t be, how can I say that, we shouldn&#8217;t look back on the past and, oh, imagine when we didn&#8217;t have to do this and didn&#8217;t do that and paint the pretty picture of how it was. Because the past, it wasn&#8217;t great. I&#8217;ve been in web development for a while now, and there never was this super bliss that somehow got destroyed with everything that is here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But the thing is that it&#8217;s been the same. But for me, the way I look at it, it&#8217;s that you are always going to have problems, but I want to have bigger problems and better problems. So there&#8217;s a myth that, oh, a thousand dollar client is going to bicker and then a $10,000 client just going to wire the money.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I don&#8217;t know where these people come from, but that&#8217;s definitely not the case. All clients are difficult at all price ranges. That&#8217;s just how it is. You&#8217;re trying to build this thing together. And there&#8217;s going to be a few confrontations, and that&#8217;s just normal. But the thing is more is that, how can I say that? If I have to write one more stupid post list, I&#8217;m just going to be out of this. Who wants to go into an editor and be like, oh, this is going to be a list, and then I will get the title. I have zero interest in that, doesn&#8217;t interest me at all. It&#8217;s just I don&#8217;t want to do the same thing over and over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If I can abstract that away, great. And that&#8217;s really the idea behind is that I want to go to the things, just in terms of my career, I want to get closer to where I can produce outcomes for the client and rewriting a list of posts, how much of an outcome are you producing? I&#8217;m not really sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so everything that I take, all of these tools is just, I want to deal with bigger problems, better problems, and that way I&#8217;m going to be able to make more money, frankly speaking. And so if you just get bogged down into this small, kind of, small thinking where we need to say, oh, I need to write everything from scratch. No you don&#8217;t. there are huge parts of projects that I didn&#8217;t write myself, but I know which solutions are out there. And so, I don&#8217;t come up with an SEO framework. I use a plugin for that. I don&#8217;t come up with a bunch of things. But because I have solved all these problems, I can then have better problems.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s the idea that I want to take. I want to get to the really hard stuff and yeah, definitely full site editing helps with all of that. It abstracts away a lot of the theming stuff that&#8217;s very repetitive. Blocks are a lot more portable. Even if we do write custom code, there&#8217;s a way to make it more abstract so that we can pull in libraries and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that way you are kind of building up, project by project and not only building up experience, but you&#8217;re also building up your toolbox so that when you come to a problem, you&#8217;ll reach in to the toolbox, you pull it out, you can solve the issue, and then you&#8217;re onto the next one. Which hopefully is going to be more interesting than how does the pagination look.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Nice answer. Fränk, I&#8217;m afraid we&#8217;re probably just going to have to knock it on the head because of the time. But just before we do, just before we call a close to the podcast episode. I&#8217;m wondering if people have listened to this and have been inspired and would like to get in touch with you, what other best ways or way to do that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:45:36] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> First, it is my website, so WP Development Courses. So check that out. Feel free to email me like there&#8217;s a contact tab. I like to hear from people. I don&#8217;t have all the answers for sure, and I like to hear from people and understand all the different backgrounds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then I&#8217;m on the WordPress.org Slack. If you wanna DM me. And of course you can find me on Twitter. So if you have a question, if you have a problem, if you have a viewpoint, if you disagree, let me hear it. I&#8217;m very interested in hearing all of your perspectives and your struggles.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Fränk Klein, thank you very much for chatting to us on the podcast today. I really appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:46:09] <strong>Fränk Klein:</strong> Thank you. It was a pleasure.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/frank-klein/\">Fränk Klein</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk is a self-taught developer. He started out learning PHP in 2011 and from there found his way to WordPress. Over the years he’s worked for Automattic at WordPress.com and WordPress VIP, and is now a principal developer at <a href=\"https://humanmade.com/\">Human Made</a>, an enterprise WordPress agency.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today on the podcast we talk about how Fränk decided early on that he was going to start developing with blocks and, more recently, with the full site editing capabilities now built into WordPress Core.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about the four phases of the Gutenberg project: content editing, site customisation, collaborative editing and multilingual, and where full site editing fits into this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk explains how he sees the adoption of Gutenberg as inevitable. WordPress is moving away from the classic approach of content creation to a more visual, block-based experience. He thinks that it’s important to become an expert at building websites and custom solutions for clients, and for taking the time to learn the new tools that this future will require.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He’s not suggesting that the journey towards expertise in React and JavaScript will be easy, but he sees it as essential for those wishing to continue to use WordPress as their CMS of choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He also makes the point that now is a great time to invest in yourself as there are more resources than ever which can assist you in this learning path.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As you’ll hear, Fränk is all-in on WordPress and is very optimistic about the future for experienced WordPress developers.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Fränk&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wpdevelopment.courses/\">WP Development Courses</a></p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Nov 2022 16:05:31 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Nathan Wrigley\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:11;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"WPTavern: WooCommerce Store Owners Combat Fraudulent Stripe Charges\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=139318\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:78:\"https://wptavern.com/woocommerce-store-owners-combat-fraudulent-stripe-charges\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:6352:\"<p>For the past few weeks, members of the Advanced WordPress Facebook (AWP) group have been <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/advancedwp/permalink/5843275932401239/\">discussing</a> methods of combatting Stripe Card Testing fraud. WordPress developer Jon Brown opened the topic after seeing fraudulent charges on five different websites, including four using WooCommerce and one using the Leaky Paywall platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;All five were on Cloudflare with bot fight mode on when it first happened,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;I&#8217;ve added CAPTCHA to all 5, I&#8217;ve enabled CloudFlare&#8217;s &#8216;Under Attack&#8217; mode on the cart/checkout page.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WooCommerce sites didn&#8217;t have a reoccurrence but the Leaky Paywall site did. Brown said the client didn&#8217;t notice it, as he had Stripe emails going to his spam folder.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;It went on for two weeks until the load spike took the site offline and I noticed it,&#8221; he said. &#8220;About 1,200 successful transactions for $2.99, with 100,000 blocked.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Brown said he doesn&#8217;t understand why Stripe doesn&#8217;t recognize and block the fraudulent charges since they all follow a similar pattern using a randomized Gmail address. His client had to dispute approximately 100 of these transactions.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Each dispute costs $15 to resolve,&#8221; Brown said. &#8220;Each non-disputed refund costs $0.40 since Stripe (like PayPal now) keeps the fee.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;So 100 * $15 + 1100 * $0.40 = $1940 in lost revenue to fees and that&#8217;s obviously AFTER also refunding the $2.99 per fraudulent transaction. That means $3,600 in fraud ($2.99 * 1200) just resulted in a net loss of $1940 &#8211; that&#8217;s insane.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many other developers in the conversation have been hit with similar attacks, some with honeypots in place that didn&#8217;t prevent anything. One recommended using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-blocker-lite-prevent-fake-orders-and-blacklist-fraud-customers/\">WooCommerce Fraud Prevention</a> plugin. It allows store owners to block orders from specific IP addresses, emails, address, state, and zip codes. This might help once attacks have started but doesn&#8217;t fully prevent them. Some developers had success stopping attacks using <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/products/recaptcha-for-woocommerce/\">reCaptcha for WooCommerce</a>, a commercial plugin that implement&#8217;s Google&#8217;s reCaptcha V2 (checkbox) and reCaptcha V3 to stop things like unauthorized login attempts, fake registrations, fake guest orders, and other automated attacks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We ran into this about a year ago,&#8221; WordPress developer John Montgomery said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a way for hackers/thieves to check a list of card numbers for ones that are valid. Once they confirm the card works on a site, they can use to purchase products for real. In the end, a big annoyance but honestly not a huge deal for us in the end because we have digital products and they weren&#8217;t really interested in those.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Montgomery installed a plugin called <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/limit-orders/\">Limit Orders for WooCommerce</a>, developed by Nexcess, that disallows orders after a certain threshold is met. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I set it up to x orders per hour ( above any historical numbers)&#8230;so if we get say 100 orders in an hour it will shut off orders,&#8221; he said. &#8220;It&#8217;s a bit of a sledgehammer, but it did help us once already.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Although many store owners are hesitant to add any friction to the checkout process, technology consultant Jordan Trask recommends requiring customers create accounts before continuing and verify emails. He wrote a guide on <a href=\"https://managingwp.io/2021/07/08/dealing-with-card-testing-or-carding-attacks-on-your-woocommerce-store-fraudulent-charges/\">dealing with card testing attacks</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The gist of the rules is blocking all countries except those you serve,&#8221; Trask said. &#8220;However, for WooCommerce, I would put in a JS Managed Challenge for the cart and checkout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There is rate limiting built into Cloudflare that might help, but it&#8217;s more request based versus per order which is what you need based on IP potentially. If the requests come from the same IP address, you can look at limiting orders per IP since the email differs each time.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://github.com/BrianHenryIE/bh-wc-checkout-rate-limiter/\">Checkout Rate Limiter</a> plugin, available on GitHub, offers checkout rate limiting on WooCommerce checkout based on IP address.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Trask&#8217;s guide also recommends checking payment processor logs when investigating fraudulent charges:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Always check your payment processor logs to verify where the charges are being created. A staging site may exist with production API keys, or your site was hacked, and the API keys were stolen. Most payment processors will have further details in their logs with additional information.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress developer Rahul Nagare recommends checking out <a href=\"https://stripe.com/radar/fraud-teams\">Stripe&#8217;s Radar fraud protection</a>, which uses machine learning to provide advanced protection and identification of fraudsters.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This will let you setup custom rules on Stripe to reject suspicious transactions,&#8221; Nagare said. &#8220;This used to be a free service with Stripe, but they changed it last year. I&#8217;d look into blocking all transactions with risk score higher than the average, and maybe the region of the card testers.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WooCommerce&#8217;s documentation has a section on <a href=\"https://woocommerce.com/document/payments/faq/card-testing\">responding to card testing attacks</a>, which has many of the same recommendations discussed in the recent AWP thread. A CAPTCHA plugin is the first line of defense. It also recommends avoiding pay-what-you-want or donation products with no minimum, as these products are often targeted for card tests with small transactions that cardholders might miss. Swiftly refunding any successful fraudulent orders will decrease the possibility of disputes.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Wed, 09 Nov 2022 04:37:29 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:51:\"WordPress.org blog: Introducing Twenty Twenty-Three\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:35:\"https://wordpress.org/news/?p=13892\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:67:\"https://wordpress.org/news/2022/11/introducing-twenty-twenty-three/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:2174:\"<p><em>This post was written in collaboration with Lauren Stein (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/laurlittle/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>laurlittle</a>) and Anne McCarthy <a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/annezazu/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>annezazu</a>)</em>.</p>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<p>Twenty Twenty-Three is here, alongside WordPress 6.1!

It takes less than 10 minutes to answer the 31-question survey. Respondents are asked if their organizations have increased the use of OSS over the last year and in which categories of software they have invested the most in terms of projects, budget, and resources. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://opensource.org/ten-takeaways-from-the-2022-state-of-open-source-survey\">The 2022 survey</a> had 2,660 respondents. It found the #1 reason respondents are using OSS is access to innovation, followed by cost reduction and security/availability of patches. More than 36% of respondents indicated that they significantly increased their use of OSS over the past year. The 2022 survey found the biggest barrier to adopting open source software was the lack of internal skills to test, use, integrate, and support it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last call has gone out to contribute to this year&#8217;s survey. It would be good to have WordPress software organizations represented in the results as part of the broader OSS community. Respondents who take the time to fill out the survey are entered for a chance to win a $200 Amazon gift card.

Three months ago, WordPress&#8217; Executive Director Josepha Haden Chomphosy <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-contributors-consider-renaming-full-site-editing\">proposed</a> renaming FSE to something more user friendly. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>After a lengthy <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/27/giving-fse-a-more-user-friendly-name/\">discussion</a>, Haden Chomphosy has <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/updates/2022/11/04/site-editor-a-more-user-friendly-name/\">announced</a> the decision to use &#8220;Site Editor&#8221; going forward:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Landing on Site Editor was the result of two key considerations. Firstly, Site Editor offers a clear and simple description to users with a range of technical skills. Secondly, there was substantial support for Site Editor, particularly from the Polyglot community, as the term that translates most effectively into hundreds of different languages.<em>&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://videopress.com/v/BJyPZJNx?at=1420\">As we heard at WordCamp US 2022</a>, better multilingual support is an important future direction for WordPress, so choosing easily translated terms is an important step.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Editor also keeps the spirit of its original FSE codename as the powerful, full collection of features it encompasses. As a bonus, it also doesn’t cost us anything from an SEO or marketing standpoint, since it’s a simplification of the existing term.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Haden Chomphosy said the change is not necessarily a rebranding, but WordPress&#8217; official documentation, including Learn.WordPress videos, and many third-party resources are replete with references to FSE. The <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/test/handbook/full-site-editing-outreach-experiment/\">Full Site Editing Outreach Program</a> may also need to be renamed. Haden Chomphosy said WordPress users can still expect to see or hear the term FSE around &#8211; it&#8217;s not a situation where every instance needs to be erased. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The recent decision to use the term &#8220;Site Editor&#8221; should be considered an official update to WordPress&#8217; shared lexicon, and Haden Chomphosy encouraged contributors to begin updating the documentation immediately to reflect the change.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Mon, 07 Nov 2022 22:32:18 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:16;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:41:\"Donncha: How to add your blog to Mastodon\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://odd.blog/?p=89504202\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:61:\"https://odd.blog/2022/11/06/how-to-add-your-blog-to-mastodon/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:8004:\"<p><strong>Introduction</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before we start, do you know what Mastodon is? It&#8217;s sort of like email, where you can send an email from gmail.com to a yahoo.com account, except it looks very like Twitter. This <a href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/how-to-get-started-on-mastodon-and-leave-twitter-behind\">pcmag article</a> is a good introduction to it. Jeff Jarvis wrote a <a href=\"https://medium.com/whither-news/hope-for-a-post-musk-net-f156d0cdf431\">good post</a> too, and Time Magazine <a href=\"https://time.com/6229230/mastodon-eugen-rochko-interview/\">interviewed Eugen Rochko</a>, the founder of Mastodon that you should read.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>This weekend, a probably sizeable chunk of <a rel=\"tag\" class=\"u-tag u-category\" href=\"https://odd.blog/tag/irishtwitter/\">#IrishTwitter</a> migrated to Mastodon. We&#8217;re not the only ones. Twitter has been getting more hateful and acting as an echo chamber for lots of horrible people over the years. The sale of Twitter to Elon Musk, the firing of half the staff, his pronouncements of &#8220;free speech&#8221; all point towards the site being less regulated, less maintained and less moderated. You can&#8217;t deal with complaints if there&#8217;s nobody there listening to complaints of harassment or hate.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<img />(No we didn&#8217;t)</div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t doubt that many of us will continue to visit and contribute to whatever Twitter becomes. Over the last few years, most of my interactions there have been publicising my blog posts. All I could see on there was angry tweets from different people, or people who were broadcasting their top ten ways of doing X, Y or Z. Hardly any actual conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, Mastodon. I woke up early on Saturday morning and discovered there was a <a rel=\"tag\" class=\"u-tag u-category\" href=\"https://odd.blog/tag/twittermigraton/\">#TwitterMigraton</a> to Mastodon. I already had an account on mastodon.social but Irish Twitter was moving to mastodon.ie, and that&#8217;s where I went too, creating <a href=\"https://mastodon.ie/@donncha\">@donncha@mastodon.ie</a>. </p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<a href=\"https://mastodon.ie/@Drharoldnews/109297557723889180\"><img /></a></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Judging from what I&#8217;ve read elsewhere, all mastodon instances are <a href=\"https://bitcoinhackers.org/@mastodonusercount\">experiencing a HUGE surge in user registrations</a> as people look for an alternative to the <s>stinking</s> sinking ship that is Twitter.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<a href=\"https://bitcoinhackers.org/@mastodonusercount/109298398614165507\"><img /></a></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>On Saturday, the admins of mastodon.ie ran into performance difficulties as they dealt <a href=\"https://mastodon.ie/@dregin/109296394011395383\">with the influx of new users</a>. The site slowed down and people couldn&#8217;t upload images. Over 6,000 people are on that instance now.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<img />Remember the early days of Twitter?</div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>The admins increased their hosting plan, eventually maxing out at the top tier. To pay for hosting they <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/mastodonie\">asked for donations</a>. Right now they have raised over €4100!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How do I add my WordPress blog to Mastodon?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s mostly straight forward. Install these two plugins:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/\">ActivityPub</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/webfinger/\">WebFinger</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The installation instructions are unfortunately not great. After you install both plugins, go to your Profile page (Users-&gt;Profile) and scroll right to the end. Down there you will find your profile identifier. It will look like @author@hostname.tld. For this blog that is <strong>@donncha@odd.blog</strong>, and I have my photoblog at <strong>@donncha@inphotos.org</strong>. Search for those on Mastodon and you will find my two blogs. Please feel free to follow!</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<img /></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p>When a post is made and shared on Mastodon, it allows others to reply. Those replies to the <a href=\"https://mastodon.social/@Gargron/108352419081380277\">toot</a> on Mastodon will be sent to your WordPress blog as a <a href=\"https://inphotos.org/2022/11/06/on-stage-in-coughlans-bar/#comment-385708\">comment</a>! That <a href=\"https://mastodon.ie/@donncha/109296714735893201\">blew my mind</a> when I discovered that!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Troubleshooting</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I discovered that running the plugins on a multi-site WordPress install will cause problems. Instead of activating it on the root install, you need to activate it on each one. I presume that&#8217;s maybe because the rewrite rules are added on plugin activation, but that&#8217;s just a guess.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have caching you might want to turn it off, or at the very least disable caching in /.well-known/ as that&#8217;s where Mastodon and other services will query your server for updated information.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It can take 10 to 15 minutes before a new post is seen. Be patient!</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Why not?</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s one reason you might not want to do this. Your blog will be on a Fediverse instance by itself. Your blog posts will only show if someone is following it, or <a href=\"https://inphotos.org/2022/11/06/on-stage-in-coughlans-bar/\">you boost the toots on Mastodon</a>, or in the Federated feed. They won&#8217;t show in the Local Feed of your Mastodon instance. The best way around this is by careful use of relevant hashtags, but please don&#8217;t spam them, or you&#8217;ll be blocked.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-image is-style-default\">\n<img /></div>\n\n\n<p></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Alternatives</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can hook your WordPress blog to your account too. I haven&#8217;t used them, but I saw two people use these plugins. Those posts will appear in the Local Feed of your Mastodon instance, which is a plus for discoverability.</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/autopost-to-mastodon/\">Mastodon Autopost</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/syndication-links/\">Syndication Links</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>You can also use IFTTT if your site can&#8217;t run plugins, and you have an RSS feed. Some details in <a href=\"https://hyperborea.org/journal/2017/12/mastodon-ifttt/\">this blog post</a>. Thanks Sandy for that link!</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m very excited about this. Is it too early to say that there&#8217;s enough momentum to sustain a <a rel=\"tag\" class=\"u-tag u-category\" href=\"https://odd.blog/tag/irishmastodon/\">#IrishMastodon</a> community? I hope it succeeds.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Edit: George has a <a href=\"https://g13g.blog/2021/03/16/get-your-blog-posts-on-mastodon/\">guide on his blog</a> explaining how to do the same thing but points out that you need the WebMention plugin to receive replies as comments. I saw replies to my toots appear here as comments, but only if they were direct replies. If I replied to someone who replied to my blog that reply wouldn&#8217;t show as a comment, and I just tested that again and WebMention doesn&#8217;t change that, unfortunately.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://matthewthom.as/\">Matthew Thomas</a> has created a remote follow tool called apfollow, with <a href=\"https://github.com/mwt/apfollow/\">source available</a>. This creates a page where you can follow a Mastodon account by entering your own details in a box and it redirects you to your home server to do the follow.

The recent 6.1 release resolved a <a href=\"https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6479\">ticket</a> that lead developer Mark Jaquith opened 15 years ago to encourage people to change their taglines. The tagline has now been changed to an empty string for new installations. This was added as a note of interest in the 6.1 release post, which was the first place many learned about it:</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>&#8220;The site tagline is empty by default in new sites but can be modified in General Settings.&#8221;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>For those who are sentimental about the tagline, rest assured that it has been preserved as placeholder text in the admin. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I do think the easier solution is to replace the &#8216;Just another WordPress site&#8217; value with a placeholder,&#8221; WordPress Core Committer Jb Audras said in the discussion on the ticket. &#8220;By doing this, we keep this sentence which is in my opinion part of the WordPress history —by doing so, it would at least appear on the Settings screen, so we keep this signature sentence somewhere on the admin— but the value is empty by default for new installs.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is the solution he committed, which landed in 6.1.  The commit message identifies the reasoning behind the change: </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>Administration: Change default site tagline to an empty string.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This changeset replaces the default &#8220;Just another WordPress site&#8221; tagline with an empty string for new installations. The reasoning is:</p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li>Not all themes display the tagline;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Not everyone changes the default tagline;</li>\n\n\n\n<li>When people don&#8217;t see the tagline in their theme, they may not realize it is still visible in some places, like feeds.</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<p>The string &#8220;Just another WordPress site&#8221; and the related multisite string: &#8220;Just another {NETWORK} site&#8221; are now only used as a placeholder for the tagline admin option.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>The advent of block themes was also another factor, since the Customizer was where users often managed their taglines in the past. Contributors concluded that the increasing use of block themes might result in more people who have the default tagline on their sites without even knowing about it. The conclusion was it is better to make it an empty string than to add a bunch of admin prompts to update it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is a welcome change to how taglines are presented, and it was past time to update it. Although most WordPress professionals had become accustomed to it, more casual users often searched for how to get rid of it, sometimes without knowing it could be customized. The message also wasn&#8217;t doing WordPress any favors, unless it was originally written to imply WordPress&#8217; ubiquity on the web &#8211; a claim that was aspirational at the time it was first committed to core. In that case, it has long since served its purpose. An empty string ensures that the only taglines showing up for new installations are ones that admins intentionally wrote for their sites.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Sat, 05 Nov 2022 01:13:08 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:19;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:91:\"WPTavern: Anders Norén Releases Oaknut, a New Profile Block Theme with 23 Style Variations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=139197\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:100:\"https://wptavern.com/anders-noren-releases-oaknut-a-new-profile-block-theme-with-23-style-variations\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:3134:\"<p><a href=\"https://andersnoren.se/\">Anders Norén</a>, a Swedish designer and prolific WordPress theme developer, has released <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/oaknut/\">Oaknut</a>, a new profile block theme reminiscent of services like <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/\">Linktree</a> and <a href=\"https://carrd.co/\">Carrd</a>. The theme is for users who want a simple profile landing page with relevant social and work links, but it could also be easily expanded to capture email addresses for a newsletter, add a blog, or serve as a placeholder for a coming soon website.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Oaknut includes just three templates: Home (displays posts on the homepage, or on the Posts page if a static homepage is set), Index (displays posts), and 404 (displays when no content is found). Users who want to expand the theme beyond the basic use case can add more templates through the Site Editor or even create their own custom templates.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wp-themes.com/oaknut/\">demo</a> looks just like the screenshot, and there are no other pages to view. After installing and activating the theme, clicking on Customize will go to the Site Editor where everything you see in the demo is already in place, ready to be replaced with your own profile data and links.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If the bright mustard color is too much for your taste, you&#8217;re in luck with Oaknut, because it packages a whopping 23 different style variations. Norén has also included 14 font families, eight button styles, and five styles for social links.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>As one of the pioneers in the block themes category Norén ensured Oaknut was ready to showcase new features released in <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-6-1-introduces-new-default-theme-and-fluid-typography-expands-design-tools-and-template-options\">WordPress 6.1</a>. The theme supports fluid typography, spacing sizes, root padding aware elements, pseudo selector styles in theme.json, and theme.json styling for elements like buttons, captions, and headings.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This enables Oaknut to have a really small CSS file,&#8221; Norén said. &#8220;It comes in at less than 150 lines, and 120 of those lines are for the custom block styles included in the theme. Combine that with locally hosted variable fonts and the complete lack of JavaScript in the theme, and you end up with some pretty speedy profile pages.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Norén shared a screenshot of a website using the theme with a Lighthouse performance score of 100.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Oaknut is a good choice for WordPress users who want a simple, attractive theme that shows how people can connect with them. It is also great for those who are just starting out with a web presence or domains that need a nicely- designed placeholder. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The theme is <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/oaknut/\">available on WordPress.org</a> to download for free. Norén has also created a <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/andersnoren\">GitHub Sponsors account</a> for anyone who wants to support the continued development of his 26 free WordPress themes and future theme releases.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Nov 2022 20:42:27 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:20;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:93:\"Post Status: What is the WordPress community capable of?

There are literally thousands of people who bring positivity to and work hard for the WordPress community. <em>Kudos to each and every one of them!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The Bad Apples: </strong>Usually we try to not talk about the negative things.

If someone is a personal problem to one of us, it’s usually kept out of the public eye. We soldier on and do our best to ignore minor pests. But sometimes those pests aren’t just pests. Sometimes they are intent on destruction, and they will use any means necessary to hurt others. My hat is off to Mika for being strong through the entirety of what she has endured over years of stalking, attack, malignment, and worse — all as part of her commitment to the <strong>Plugins Team</strong>. <em>No one should ever have to go through what she has.</em> It’s beyond brave of her to <a href=\"https://halfelf.org/harassment-rst/\">share with the community</a>, and I, for one, am grateful that she has. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-bf-cm\">BF/CM</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Black Friday/Cyber Monday is coming quickly! <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/submit-black-friday-cyber-monday-deals/\">Submit your deals here</a>. </li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/2022-black-friday-cyber-monday-wordpress-deals/\">Find this year’s deals here</a>.

However, given the heftiness of the topic, it has evolved into a full overview of the layout framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The primary goals for this walk-through are to provide developers with an overall view of the system and to know which classes are able to be targeted via CSS. </p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-group has-light-background-background-color has-background is-layout-constrained\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<p class=\"has-large-font-size\"><strong>Table of contents</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-sortabrilliant-guidepost\"><ul><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#0-an-overview-of-layout-related-classes\">An Overview of Layout-Related Classes</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#1-block-gaps-and-vertical-rhythm\">Block Gaps and Vertical Rhythm</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#2-constrained-and-flow-layouts\">Constrained and Flow Layouts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#3-flex-layouts\">Flex Layouts</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#4-content-justification\">Content Justification</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#5-avoid-code-wp-container-code-classes\">Avoid .wp-container-* Classes</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#6-future-layout-types\">Future Layout Types</a></li><li><a href=\"https://gutenbergtimes.com/feed/#7-resources-to-learn-more\">Resources to learn more</a></li></ul></div>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"0-an-overview-of-layout-related-classes\">An Overview of Layout-Related Classes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Layout-related classes are given to container-type blocks in WordPress. They define how nested blocks are aligned within their parent.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most extenders will immediately associate layout classes with the Group block and its Row and Stack variations. However, WordPress uses the classes for other blocks, such as Social Icons, Navigation, and Buttons. Layouts may also be used with third-party blocks, even though support is currently marked as an experimental feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The following list is a bird&#8217;s-eye view of the currently-available classes in WordPress 6.1. Most of the class names should describe their roles, but don&#8217;t worry if you don&#8217;t understand all of them yet. In this walk-through, you will learn what each does.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Layout Classes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><code>is-layout-constrained</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>is-layout-flow</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>is-layout-flex</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Flex Orientation (Direction) Classes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><code>.is-vertical</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>.is-horizontal</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Content Justification Classes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><code>.is-content-justification-left</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>.is-content-justification-center</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>.is-content-justification-right</code></li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>.is-content-justification-space-between</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Flex Wrap Classes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><code>.is-nowrap</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li><strong>Container Classes:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li><code>.wp-container-{id}</code></li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"1-block-gaps-and-vertical-rhythm\">Block Gaps and Vertical Rhythm</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Before diving into each layout type, it&#8217;s important to understand how vertical spacing between blocks works. Much of the system relies on this feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As any good designer will tell you, vertical rhythm is a crucial aspect of any design. And vertical spacing between elements, while only one aspect of the rhythm, plays a vital part in getting the design right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress, this is the <code>blockGap</code> property. Do not let the name confuse you. While it maps to the CSS <code>gap</code> property in some layouts, it is also used to set <code>margin-block-start</code> in others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Any theme can set the default via <code>styles.spacing.blockGap</code> in their <code>theme.json</code>, as shown in the following code snippet:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"$schema\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"styles\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"spacing\"</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"blockGap\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"2rem\"</span>\n        }\n    }\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-4\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JSON / JSON with Comments</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">json</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>Themes can also target the <code>blockGap</code> property for blocks that support it. The following code example shows how to set the default spacing while customizing it for the Group block:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-json\">{\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"$schema\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"https://schemas.wp.org/trunk/theme.json\"</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"version\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">2</span>,\n    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"styles\"</span>: {\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"spacing\"</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"blockGap\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"2rem\"</span>\n        },\n        <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"blocks\"</span>: {\n            <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"core/group\"</span>: {\n                <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"spacing\"</span>: {\n                    <span class=\"hljs-attr\">\"blockGap\"</span>: <span class=\"hljs-string\">\"1rem\"</span>\n                }\n            }\n        }\n    }\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-5\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">JSON / JSON with Comments</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">json</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>There may be edge cases where you need to overrule the default via CSS. For those scenarios, it&#8217;s typically best to change the value of the <code>--wp--style--block-gap</code> CSS property rather than targeting a block&#8217;s <code>gap</code> or <code>margin</code>. You would do this as shown in the following CSS code:</p>\n\n\n<pre class=\"wp-block-code\"><div><code class=\"hljs language-css\"><span class=\"hljs-selector-class\">.some-target-class</span> {\n    <span class=\"hljs-attribute\">--wp--style--block-gap</span>: <span class=\"hljs-number\">3rem</span>;\n}</code></div><small class=\"shcb-language\" id=\"shcb-language-6\"><span class=\"shcb-language__label\">Code language:</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__name\">CSS</span> <span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">(</span><span class=\"shcb-language__slug\">css</span><span class=\"shcb-language__paren\">)</span></small></pre>\n\n\n<p>That may not always work. If a block (via <code>theme.json</code>) or user (via the interface) has defined a specific value for <code>blockGap</code>, that value will be used instead of the CSS property. In those cases, you should not attempt to overwrite the choice via CSS.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With an understanding of how the space between blocks is defined, you now have the foundation for seeing how that operates within different layout types.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"2-constrained-and-flow-layouts\">Constrained and Flow Layouts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Both of these layout types are technically flow layouts. This is how browsers handle the normal flow of a webpage without any intervention from CSS. WordPress defines the spacing between blocks by applying the <code>blockGap</code> value to the <code>margin-block-start</code> property of nested blocks (<code>margin-block-end</code> is zeroed out).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There is one key difference between the two layouts in WordPress:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Nested blocks within a <strong>constrained</strong> layout are limited by the theme&#8217;s content width by default (this can be overwritten with wide/full alignments).</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Nested blocks within a <strong>flow</strong> layout fill up the width of their parent block.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>As of WordPress 6.1, the constrained layout type is the default for the Group block. Other blocks may define different defaults.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the following screenshot, you can see a wide-aligned Group block with a Paragraph and Image nested inside. However, these child blocks are &#8220;constrained&#8221; to the content width by the <strong>Inner blocks use content width</strong> setting in the sidebar:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If you toggle the switch for <strong>Inner blocks use content width</strong> to the off position, the layout would become a &#8220;flow&#8221; layout.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress handles all of this out of the box. Theme authors should primarily be aware of the classes associated with each layout, which are <code>.is-layout-constrained</code> and <code>.is-layout-flow</code>. For the majority of use cases, there will never be a need to use those. However, when you need to style blocks or elements specifically within those layouts, target the specific layout class.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"3-flex-layouts\">Flex Layouts</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Flex layouts in WordPress work on the Flexbox system in CSS. In reality, it is a limited subset of what is possible with Flexbox that fits within WordPress&#8217; design framework.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One major difference between flex and constrained/flow layout types is how they handle block spacing. Instead of applying the <code>blockGap</code> value to a block&#8217;s <code>margin-block-start</code> property, the value is applied to the containing block&#8217;s <code>gap</code> property.  Flex layouts also have options between vertical and horizontal layouts. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Several container-type blocks have flex layouts by default, including:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>Buttons</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Social Icons</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Navigation</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the Group block example from earlier, you should see <strong>Layout</strong> variations for creating a <strong>Stack</strong> and <strong>Row</strong> in the block inspector. Take a look at the Row variation, which has a horizontal layout:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>If the Stack variation had been chosen, the blocks would have been aligned vertically.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the addition of vertical and horizontal options, there are a few layout-specific classes that theme authors can target when necessary:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>.is-layout-flex</code>: Whether the layout has the flex type.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>.is-vertical</code>: Whether the layout has a vertical orientation.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>.is-horizontal</code>: Whether the layout has a horizontal orientation.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Those last two map to the <code>flex-direction</code> CSS property. Horizontal layouts are given the <code>row</code> value and vertical layouts the <code>column</code> value.</p>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-body-background-color has-accent-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><strong>Note:</strong> The the default orientation for a block may not exist as a class in the block&#8217;s HTML, so you would need to target the layout class directly in that case.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Flex layouts also have another option to disallow nested blocks from wrapping to a new line as they grow. This is tied to the <code>flex-wrap</code> CSS property. The default value is for blocks to wrap, which is noticeable as you add multiple blocks to a horizontal layout. However, this can be disabled via the editor. In those cases, WordPress applies the <code>.is-nowrap</code> class to the element.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"4-content-justification\">Content Justification</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress 6.1, the constrained and flex layout types both have content justification classes. These handle how the nested elements are aligned within their parent block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Looking at the same example Group block from earlier, the following screenshot has a constrained layout with the content justified right:</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>There are four different content justification options for container blocks, each with their own CSS class:</p>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><code>.is-content-justification-left</code>: Nested blocks are aligned left.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>.is-content-justification-center</code>: Nested blocks are aligned center-aligned.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>.is-content-justification-right</code>: Nested blocks are aligned right.</li>\n\n\n\n<li><code>.is-content-justification-space-between</code>: Nested blocks are allowed to spread evenly with equal space between each. <em>For flex layouts only.</em></li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"5-avoid-code-wp-container-code-classes\">Avoid .wp-container-* Classes</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some blocks may have a <code>.wp-container-*</code> class attached to them. In the past, there have been instances when it was necessary to target those classes to address some shortcoming of the layout system. However, this should be avoided altogether. There is no way to know whether the classes will exist in the future or whether their behavior will change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Always opt for one of the specific classes outlined earlier. They are the standard going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"6-future-layout-types\">Future Layout Types</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>CSS allows for all types of layouts, so it should be interesting to see what the future of the block editor brings&#8212;<em>perhaps even a grid layout type</em>. The goal is not necessarily to cover every potential use case. Rather, it is to offer a solid foundation that can be iterated upon as the web continues to change.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The layout system in WordPress is still marked as an &#8220;experimental&#8221; block feature, which means it is under active development. However, WordPress 6.1 has brought us one step closer to a well-rounded and standard framework for how current and future layouts will work.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"7-resources-to-learn-more\">Resources to learn more</h2>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/updated-editor-layout-support-in-6-1-after-refactor/\">Updated editor layout support in 6.1 after refactor</a> (Dev Note WordPress 6.1 release)</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/45055#issuecomment-1303815045\">Layout Styles</a> explanations in the handbook</li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/theme-json-reference/theme-json-living/#spacing\">BlockGap in theme.json</a></li>\n\n\n\n<li><a href=\"https://developer.wordpress.org/block-editor/reference-guides/block-api/block-supports/#spacing\">Spacing  (incl BlockGap in block.json) </a></li>\n</ul>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Nov 2022 19:03:50 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:14:\"Justin Tadlock\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:22;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:47:\"Post Status: Who’s Going to Pay for All This?\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:32:\"https://poststatus.com/?p=142747\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:54:\"https://poststatus.com/whos-going-to-pay-for-all-this/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:11740:\"<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-group eplus-wrapper has-theme-palette-2-color has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-text-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\"><div class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt\"><p class=\"wp-block-post-excerpt__excerpt\"><strong>Magne Ilsaas</strong> wants WordPress to be more than the pragmatic choice for enterprise clients.

Why WordPress has been such a success in that space is now a barrier to its growth, Magne argues. It is not enough to be the pragmatic choice — the &#8220;tool that gets the job done, cheaply and effectively.&#8221; This leads to short-term engineering-focused solutions while &#8220;other [non-WordPress] agencies are helping clients with strategic decision-making, design and communication, user testing,&nbsp; conversion optimization, and digital marketing.&#8221; Magne wants WordPress agencies to be known for a distinct WordPress culture and mindset:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>What if we did business the same way we\'ve built WordPress? What if we leverage our biggest asset, which is not WordPress the tool. It’s WordPress, the community, the culture, the openness, and the inclusiveness. What if we create our own way of integrating our open-source mindset into how we conduct our businesses?</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>While talking with Magne and working on this article, which was originally drafted a few years ago, he confirmed a couple of things that have kept coming up in my reading and conversations. They each represent both threats and opportunities: </p>\n\n\n\n<ol>\n<li> All the complaints, hazards, frustrations, and wishes of big agencies and their customers are very much aligned with small agencies, freelancers, and their customers. In particular, everyone wants clear quality signals for selecting plugins that meet their needs and don\'t distort, complicate, or disrupt the user experience, especially in the admin interface.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The agency space has been a boomtown, and there are established companies, some with hundreds of employees, who do work heavily or even exclusively with WordPress but have little or no involvement with the project and community. They hire specifically for WordPress knowledge and expertise with varying degrees of technical fluency. WordPress needs them, and they need WordPress agency peer networks and gatherings whether they know it or not. </li>\n\n\n\n<li>Unfortunately, those connecting networks, events, and trade publications don\'t exist or are very underdeveloped in WordPress compared to the larger digital agency scene and web tech industry at large. It\'s important for WordPress agencies to be there too, in organizations like <a href=\"https://www.sodaspeaks.com\"><strong>SoDA</strong></a> (founded in 2007) for <a href=\"https://www.viget.com/articles/viget-joins-soda/\">the reasons described</a> by <strong>Brian Williams</strong>, co-founder and CEO of <strong>Viget</strong>, when they joined back in 2013.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Large WordCamps aren\'t meeting that need, and with the challenges of the volunteer model why should they be expected to? (<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/market-size-and-market-shares/\">We\'ve said this before</a>.)</li>\n</ol>\n\n\n\n<h2>Supporting WordPress Contributors </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the best conversations that expert listener <strong>Bob Dunn</strong> has recorded for <strong>Do the Woo</strong> are open conversations with people the WordPress community is lucky to have. This time it\'s <strong>Alain Schlesser</strong>, <strong>Carole Olinger</strong>, <strong>Carl Alexander</strong>, and <strong>Zach Stepek</strong>. An alternative title for this talk could be &#8220;Why Can\'t Contributors Have Nice Things? (Like a Living Wage).&#8221; Carl\'s impactful <strong>Twitter</strong> thread <a href=\"https://twitter.com/twigpress/status/1577668456354238464\">a few weeks ago</a> inspired the conversation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alain, Carole, Carl, and Zach all speak about the technical debt they see being piled onto WordPress — the project and the community — because of the high cost of contributing without solid or sustainable backing. Carole and Carl discuss the <strong>WordCamp</strong> volunteer model, which Carl thinks may be broken beyond repair, and with it, many years of institutional knowledge will be lost. Deep disconnection from the <strong>PHP</strong> community presents all kinds of risks and missed opportunities Alain addresses.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Behind Alain\'s voice, it\'s impossible not to hear <strong>Milana Cap</strong>‘s as they are both pointing out “<a href=\"https://developerka.org/2022/05/21/wheres-that-elephant-in-wordpress-community/\">The Elephant in the WordPress Community</a>.” As <strong>Gutenberg</strong> truly starts to round the corner with the adoption and knowledge-sharing of standard-setters like <strong>10up</strong>, maybe there will be a collective realization: it\'s time to feed the elePHPant, or at least support some of our best elePHPant handlers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In that vein, Bob mentioned in the show (and in a conversation we had this week) that next year he will be putting significant funding back into the community from Do the Woo\'s generous sponsors. But you can support <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/carlalexander\">Carl</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/sponsors/schlessera?success=true\">Alain</a> right now with any amount you choose via <strong>GitHub Sponsors</strong>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>End of the Line for PHP 7.4 in 23 Days</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>On the themes of maintenance, technical debt, and &#8220;pay now, or pay later,&#8221; unless it gets changed as WordPress project leadership has requested, <strong>PHP 7.4</strong> will <a href=\"https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php\">no longer be supported</a> with security patches as of <strong>November 28</strong>. Some hosts are forcing customers to upgrade or leave. <strong>Dave Loodts</strong>, who has found himself in the forced-to-leave category, <a href=\"https://poststatus.slack.com/archives/CHNM7Q7T8/p1667476104013399\">started a discussion about it</a> in <strong>Post Status Slack</strong>. The views offered were broad-ranging, thoughtful, and relevant to the topics mentioned above. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Marius Jensen</strong> pointed out that WordPress developers &#8220;are spending so much time keeping up with changes&#8221; to PHP in a never-ending maintenance loop &#8220;that it\'s hard to pick up new things [that can be done as PHP evolves] and innovate and use all the goodness PHP offers.&#8221; He feels &#8220;that\'s hurting our ability to move forward as well.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Jeremy Ward</strong> countered that &#8220;three years of support per release feels aggressive, particularly within our community due to the nature of our platform,&#8221; but &#8220;we can do a better job as a community at choosing an entry point with each major release to get things compatible. We knew PHP announced a change to their cadence, and to a degree, I don’t think we took them seriously that they’d stick to it. Until the <strong>PHP Federation</strong>, WordPress has more or less opted out of any language community initiatives, most notably <strong>PHP-FIG</strong>. I think all those smaller decisions kind of contribute to the challenges we face today&#8230;&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Chris Reynolds</strong> noted that even though WordPress core rarely has problems with a <strong>PHP 8</strong> environment, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/references/php-compatibility-and-wordpress-versions/\">PHP 8 only has beta support</a>, and enterprise customers aren\'t interested in anything &#8220;beta.&#8221; They need &#8220;official communications&#8221; and documents affirming full support, but WordPress\'s &#8220;official communication says it\'s not ready yet.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Quick Links</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Jb Audras</strong> has <a href=\"https://jeanbaptisteaudras.com/en/2022/11/contribution-stats-for-wordpress-6-1-misha/\">another fine report on contribution statistics</a>, now for <strong>WordPress&nbsp;6.1</strong>.

Along with WordPress, any combination of plugins and themes can be included. There’s <strong>GitHub</strong> integration, and InstaWP has the ability to push sites to a large number of hosts or pull them to a local development environment. (InstaWP generates Blueprints — .zip packages for <strong>WP Engine</strong>’s <strong>Local</strong> app.)</p>\n\n\n\n<p>InstaWP is being embraced by WordPress product developers and agencies. It has significant product testing and marketing applications since customers can spin up any number of demo sites based on a custom template, and this activity is logged. Vikas has picked up <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/post-status-notes-501/\">seed funding</a> from <strong>Automattic</strong> and looks forward to announcing many new partnerships with WordPress businesses that have found InstaWP and valuable and complementary tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Vikas sees InstaWP’s future as a marketplace for agencies, developers, and freelancers. Because of its powerful site templating and cloning capabilities, it could ultimately become a way to generate bespoke WordPress-based SaaS platforms at scale.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n\n</div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-container-26 wp-block-columns sponsor has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"StellarWP\">\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-column\">\n<h3 class=\"StellarWP\" id=\"Sponsor\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/stellarwp\">StellarWP</a><a href=\"https://poststat.us/wpengine\"></a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>StellarWP</strong> provides WordPress solutions for all humankind.

I think, I think you\'ve been Pretty familiar in at post status anyway. I know a number of members have been been using this platform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So how did, how did you put it together? What would you like to people to know who are completely new to it, who haven\'t seen Insta WP before?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Yeah. There\'s an interesting question. First of all means I would like to thank post status because that\'s where I posted about instead of the. For the first time, and that\'s where it took off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember you or you were with Dimension Media handle, right? Right. Well that\'s</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> David Bi and I Yeah, that was, he was he was [00:01:00] with us then. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Right. So yeah, you guys shooted about instead of Lupe and then it took off really well. I got initial interest initial kind of early adopters from post status.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that was great. Mince, how did I put it together, is I started with WordPress about four or five years ago, but, and then I built a plugin theme company over the years, and I also have that in parallel which is still in we are still alive. But the, the biggest thing, which I always wondered that, why don\'t we have like a good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To create a workplace website like you do, like a Shopify website or any other SAS-based platform where you just click like a great site and it, it gives you site. Instead, you either have to set up like a clunky local setup which takes away your cpu, and it\'s, it\'s, it\'s not that easy, right? And at the same time when you use your hosting account, it has its own disadvantages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Then you have to go multiple steps. [00:02:00] You have to do, you have to eat up your hosting credits and other things, right? So you don\'t, It\'s not like a really like a playground where you just create a site and then test it and then dispose it. So the initial idea was to give kind of a platform where you can create a disposable site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At least that\'s how it started. And then it obviously became something completely like not different, but more wash than the initial idea. And so that\'s how it started. And it was started about a year ago, I think, September, October 2 21. When I I created MVP and posted and post as, as I said earlier and then obviously about six months, eight months down the line we got funding from Automatic and then it, it bo it became all real and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All kind of so much pressure, , but yeah, I means we are at this point that we have like a good version, one plus plus kind of project product with, with us. A lot of folks are using it. We have about thousand websites being [00:03:00] created on Insta every day. So I like to think that we, we contribute some part of this to the workplace ecosystem wherein because we have a very generous, free plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You get five websites where you can create, in your account you have like 500 MB of disc usage. You can create a template and all that. So I know a lot of folks are using the free account and we are happy with it because that increases the engagement with the platform and that gives us a lot of feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So with that, I think it\'s time. I give you a small demo of how it looks like. Good. And then you can go from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. Are you hoping that those who are using the, the free accounts will convert and up upgrade later? Or are they they two different audience segments where people are doing very quick testing, but then maybe maybe another group is ends up using it as, as a more permanent platform or for something that they launch sites to, to other hosting providers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Yeah, so I think [00:04:00] we, as I said, we started as a disposable site platform, but then we are now allowing people with a paid account to reserve a site for extended period of time, so you don\'t need to actually let it expire. So, so these are two different personas of our users. One is someone who are just testing disposing so they don\'t need to upgrade.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And we don\'t expect them to upgrade. But then there is obviously another serious users like agency owners product owners, developers. Who, who, who want to ex explore the platform to another dimensions or another levels of what, what it can do. So that\'s, that\'s where we want.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. You have some who are using it as a permanent sandbox for demoing their own products that well they might periodically completely overhaul it, change it, put on, update their their system, but their customers are, are using it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is it, I guess they could map it to any domain that they like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Right. A lot of our agency customers, what they do is they create a. [00:05:00] The market as a permanent site. So when we say permanent on Insta is not like a hosted site, so we don\'t provide hosting. But they can still map like a custom domain to, to that Insta site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And it becomes like a white label site at that point. And you can actually show that to your client once they\'re okay with it. Who can do one click migrate to they\'re host. Account or your hosting account, however it is set up. So it doesn\'t really matter. So, so it\'s, as I said earlier before our call, that it is kind of a breeding ground, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where you like you nurture your baby and everything is okay, and then you push it off to the world, right? So, and then all your tools, all. So our vision is that we connect. All the plugin provider, all the team providers have a template store, have a product store have the, have our cloud underneath.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So when, when we become the clue, right? So we, we tie them together. And I think you shared one interesting post recently about onboarding on on WordPress. So we are trying to solve that for agencies and freelancers at least, at least for them, right? [00:06:00] And then maybe later on we can bring in DIYs as.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who want to build their site, and they will have like a ready made starter templates. So, so it, it\'ll be really, really easy for them to get a new site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Great. Well, yeah, let\'s, let\'s spin one up. You can go from scratch or, or from a, a template it looks like.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Right? So you can start from a template if you have one.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we have created some templates, so we can get back to that later. And then you can start from scratch. So you can choose WordPress version. So we, we support all the way to older version and newer, newer versions. Even better versions. I think 6.1 is what , it\'ll be added. And you can also test on multiple PHP versions all the way to 8.1.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can choose some presets of configuration wherein it is not actually like a snapshot, but it is like a set of configuration parameters. So you can say that auto in install, Astra auto install, Elementor auto install whatever dv, even if it is premium theme plugin, it doesn\'t really matter. So [00:07:00] I\'ll show that in a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can provide a site name or you can just keep it blank for a random site. So I am just keeping everything as default and clicking on Create site. Also just to for, for, for the purpose of completion that we have a temporary site option and a reserve site. So this is disabled on a free account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The free account, you can only do temporary sites. So let\'s create, let\'s do. And within a few seconds you should have a new site, new site, ready to go for you. Right. And the one, the detail which we show is obviously the url, username and password. So when you click on it, you should get a site. Up and running.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And you might notice that this particular, in this particular instance we have some faker data already populated. The reason being my default configuration has that. So if I go to configuration tab and choose default and go to Faker, so my core figurer is on, and I have created some posts, some pages, some tags, some categories.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we, so we are using Yost faker [00:08:00] internally to do all. Right. And then you can also do like a what kind of keyword you want to do for, Oh,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> what\'s a, what\'s a faker? I was looking at that yesterday and, and wondering, I\'m not familiar with that term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> So a lot of time you want a website filled with some content, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\'t really matter what kind of content you need, so, This is like that, so, Oh, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Okay. So prepopulated content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Yeah, Repopulated content. Yes. So, exactly. So some posts, some pages, some authors, so that it gives you somewhere to start, right? Not necessarily. You want to start from scratch. Sure. So you can switch it off, switch it off.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By default it is switched off and there is a lot of other configuration, as I said earlier, so you can make a default configuration of your site language multi-site. Reinstall plugins, pre-install teams and all that. So obviously a lot of options, we can go over them one by one, but let me just explain what is, what are the main features which we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So so second [00:09:00] thing is you can do like a quick auto login to your site and you don\'t need to remember you\'re using \'em in password and then it straight away goes to the WebPress admin. And then you can imagine you can just work from there. So you, you can imagine that this, these kind of features are not, Kind of not available in all the platforms.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? Some features, some platform will have some feature, but our focus is completely on making WordPress cool or WordPress easier to use, right? Right. You don\'t need to worry about installing a bunch of things to, to make these things happen. So another option is reserving a site. So if you have, let\'s.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You want this site for a longer period of time. By default, it gives you, like, based on your plan. So if you have a free plan, you, it gives you 48 hours. If you are on a paid plan, it, it goes from seven days to to up to a month, right? And we have add-ons, so you can always increase those options. So you can reserve a site and this will never expire.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And these are, this becomes like a permanent site. And then when you are comfortable, you can [00:10:00] delete it yourself if you want. The second cool option is saving this as a template. So there are multiple kind of para, multiple paradigm how you can use a template. So let me just, let me just first, first create a template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So template is nothing but like a snapshot of your site. So it saves, it saves the content, it saves the database, it shifts everything. And like a backup of your site. Let\'s say demo PS, and you can put a description, post status demo template. Somebody has taking this name ops, so let\'s say obviously add one</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah, that was probably me say, yeah. Oh, maybe you , right? So now if you go to your private template staff, this demo, this template creation is in. So it takes few moments depending upon the size of your site, and now within few seconds, you will have it ready. So basically at this [00:11:00] point there are multiple things which, which you can do with the template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So first, the most easiest option is go back to sites, click on Agnew, and you will have this from template. Now this thing is appearing here, create site. So the new site will have. Whatever you had on the parent\'s side, right? So, Right. It\'s that easy now. So it takes a few moment because now it is being created from attempted rather than scratch from, from a blank worker\'s side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it takes few moment based on the size of, of your parent\'s size. However, we, we do have an like a really interesting option where you can mark your template as an instant template. So that\'s like an advance option only available in the agency. So a lot of that is actually very useful when you like, do like a sandbox and all, and it\'ll do, it\'ll create a site instantly, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It, it won\'t, it won\'t take even a, even a second. So now this site is completely like a, like a clone of your parent\'s site [00:12:00] and only the name changes. The URL changes. So you, so whatever changes you make on the parent\'s side, obviously is not. Those changes are not affected here, right? So, so these are two different sites and you, you can see in your list also that this comes from the template.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s a small section that shows that. Now this was just the basic operation of a template. However, there are two things which can do here. One is connecting this to a get deployment. So I will not get into much detail with the interest of time, but what happens is if you have, let\'s say, a plug. Or a team on a, on a gi it can be on GitHub, it can be on Bitbucket.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It doesn\'t really matter. But we support GitHub more natively for now. But other supports are also coming. What happens is if you, let\'s say, if you have a Bud Press plugin, and the, the biggest thing, which we have noticed because we also develop plugins, is that. There are multiple developers who are working on, on a plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Let\'s say one developers [00:13:00] developing one feature. One is fixing another bug. They\'ll be doing that on their own kind of prs, right? They will have their own branches. They\'ll raise a pr. What will happen is as soon as they raise a PR and you have set up your get report with, with the template, every time there is a pr per.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They will get a special workplace deployed for them, which is created from the parent side, so it is loaded with all the bells and visuals, all the other companion plugins, all the other content. Right, right. And then it\'ll pull the latest plug-in code from that pr. So I\'ll just show that I\'ll show an example of what we have done in the past rather than connecting the whole thing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So if you see one of these prs, you will see. Sure. So for example, I changed this file, so I changed the version of my WordPress plugin. So what happens is as soon I raise this pr my new WordPress instance was deployed. Instead of loopy and it had then that new code. So you can [00:14:00] imagine the, the impact of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So it, so within moments you get a site and you can test your new feature, and then when you close the pr, that site will be destroyed. Right? Right. So that site is gone. And this is kind of one of the most asked, most used featured by, especially the product developers, the the who are developing for breakfast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. So the next cool option is the share template. So once you mark a template as share it becomes, it is basically a sandbox at that point, right? So it, now if you go to the share tab and this demo, PS one is actually having a shared link, right? So if I open that, copy that and open in a new. What happens is I get a landing page and the interesting thing thing about is this landing page is that it is available for all users, not just logged in users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? So this is ready to go anybody. [00:15:00] So let me open this in, in Incog mode, and you will see that this is this exact landing page pages available for an anonymous user. Now what, what are you doing exactly? You have offered your template. As like a sandbox for anybody to test. And this is what a lot of folks are doing as you said, as we discussed earlier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let me enter an email id and then within seconds it\'ll start creating a site based on a template, and then it\'ll give you to the user. Now, if you go back to your panel, we have simple statistics built in. So if you click on statistics you\'ll see that one site was created today, first November. And then if you go to table, you will see that the site was created, who created it, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And there are like tons of options you want to create. If you want to collect email, you want to link it to your MailChimp account, ah, that you want to call a web. So,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> so that, that, that initial login box I saw it had a checkbox for a newsletter that could Right. That\'s not yours. [00:16:00] That\'s a instant wp. That could be the the right, the user for someone\'s doing a sandbox for their plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Right. So you, you can actually change everything. So, so we show a quick preview of why you\'re changing it. So let\'s say you don\'t want to collect email, right? So this thing will be gone. But if you want to collect email and you want to hide the previously check box, you can hide that. You can mark email as required if you want to like change the previous policy text.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Wow. So let\'s say, yeah, So this is a new policy. Let\'s see. And you can see it real time changing. We also send out an email when somebody. A website which, so this email can be completely customized based on like your brand, you can upload a brand logo, so this instead of logo will be replaced by that logo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All this obviously is in paid plan, so not available for paid users. Free users. However, free users can come up to this point with all the options as default, and they can still create a shared template, one shared template in a free.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So this is, this [00:17:00] would be great for marketing purposes than if, or, or if you wanted to have a select group of people test a new feature and, and give feedback.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But this would give you some, some good data back on if you did a campaign of test some new features or, or Try before you buy,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> right? Yeah. A lot of companies, like even Gravity forms, they\'re using for beta releases. So they\'re select group of people who are doing beta testing. So they create a template because a template has all the, all the things, as I said earlier, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content plugin, and they can create new instances based on the template and they\'re ready. Nice. You can also set lifetime of these sites, which I created from the template. So it can go from 30 minutes all up to 15 days. In fact WordPress, full site editing outreach experiment. I don\'t know if you know that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connected by Annie. Oh. Yes. Great. So they are using this as a part of their. Outreach. Does</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> the does the use data then get logged separately? So if, if a site expires that [00:18:00] someone has, has used, you\'re still getting An aggregate of, of all the data that, that\'s been produced by users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Right, Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So yeah. So basic status effects will include even the expired sites. So here, this, this data will show even if the site expires, because you need to, you need to see the trend. But we are coming up with some advanced statistics on how much time did the user use, how many pages did they visit? Things like that, Right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What was the actual usage pattern of the user so that you can take informed decisions based on that,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> right? Oh, that\'s terrific.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Right. And I can export this list as csv and yeah, you can do a lot of stuff. So, yeah, So that was about templates. So sites and templates are. The core of, instead of, But then obviously we have configurations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have deployments. Deployments is where you can connect your GitHub account and all. And then we [00:19:00] have mail shift integration and more integrations coming in. We, you can create multiple teams, so these are like workspaces. You can invite team members to different workspaces. We use it for our own team, obviously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we eat our own dog food and. So I guess in the sites thing one more thing, a couple of more things maybe shown. So you can use tools like code editor you can use tools like D Editor. So these things are like really quick, right? So, and everything about Insta is instant, right? So it has to be very, very quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You don\'t need to do any configuration. So you can see all the WordPress tables are now open up, right? So it\'s that easy, right? And same thing. So if you hover a site, you can still get the same thing. So code, I guess you have already used that. So this is something as we want to improve that. But still this is very powerful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it is like a multi tab editing experience similar to what Sublime or Visual Code provides. But we are building our own code editor [00:20:00] which will be like similar to Sublime Experience, and then it\'ll also have like a multi. Party collaboration. So let\'s say you and I can share a URL and then can, can work on the same work site online.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right. So you\'ll see mouse moving, you\'ll see them editing like similar to in Google Doc. Sure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. When I, when I tried this out, I, I found, So you have to go under file and, and click save and then it instantly becomes active on the site. Yeah. So these</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> are all active. Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Right. There\'s, there\'s not really a, It doesn\'t give you any feedback on whether you\'ve white screened the site or not, but you, you don\'t get locked out if there\'s a, a failure.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Is there any kind of error logging built in here or, or a way to roll back? Changes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> The first option is built in, so if you can hover over the site, you\'ll see view locks. Oh, okay. So here you can see error locks and access locks, and you can actually search through the locks. And we are coming up [00:21:00] with debug locks as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we\'ll switch on W P D bug, and then you can see those logs as well. And then the other one, which you talked about is rolling back is an interesting feature. So what we are trying to do is create versions of your site. So let\'s say you are working on the site and then you are good with that. You will have an option here itself on, on the top, let\'s say save snapshot or a save a version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It\'ll create like a quick version of the whole website and then you can roll back to any of the version at any point. Wow. And I guess some other cool stuff here is obviously we have this ssh. So you can enable SSH and with SSH you get access to WP cli. That is like very, very easy, very, very quick.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you can, if, if you have time, I can just show this to you real quickly. So you enable SSH takes a second and you open your ssh. So as a part of our making this even easier we will have [00:22:00] like a SSH console right here, okay? Right next to close, which will say like, open console, web console of ssh, and it\'ll open the whole thing inside the website, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you don\'t need to open your ssh client. If you want, you can do that, but you don\'t need. , right? Same with the same with ftp. So you enter your username password, enter your SSH key, boom. So you are inside your website. So let me clear this up. So you can go to the public folder and yeah, so you have all the sites and then you can do like a lot of stuff obviously.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So you have like W P C I command, you can run them right. Not a problem at all.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right. I think I\'ve covered at least 70, 80% of what we can do with Insta. Obviously there is some more things to explore and a lot of things coming up right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> And it has an [00:23:00] export feature. A lot of, a lot of us use WP Engines local product for, for local development. And that exports a blueprint right here that you can, you can import to,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> to local, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it\'ll email you a zip, a link to afi, Uhhuh , which you can download, and then just drag and drop to local w p and you don\'t need to do any configuration. Nice. Okay. And then, yeah, so map of map domain is where I think we spoke about it, is where you just create a c record to this particular site, and then you can map it to any domain of your choice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Okay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> So that\'s, that\'s great. You\'re up to a thousand. Regular customers now and are you, are you seeking further investment? What are, what\'s next for it as, as a growing business and, and what, what do you see happening in your, in your roadmap for the future?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> So we have more, more than that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We have, we are [00:24:00] actually getting thousand websites created on INTA Per day. Every day. Yeah. Per day. Right, Right, right, right. And we, we have, we are getting, we are getting great reaction from users. We are free to pay. Conversion is about five to 10%, so that is also good. And regarding further investments, we have got interest from the market to be honest.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But then we want to even test the waters even further so that because when you take money from market, it creates tremendous pressure and responsibility because you can\'t just throw that money around, right? You, you have to be, you have to own it. And so what we are doing right now is figuring out our marketing strategy wherein where, where, who is our ideal customer and who can pay us X amount so that it, it justifies the business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that\'s where we are exploring more and more things. And you will see a lot of things happening. Like we are, we are sponsoring, we sponsored a small sponsorship on work camp. And, and then work Camp Asia is a [00:25:00] bigger sponsorship. I\'ll be there personally and a lot of stuff, we, we are, our, our stuff is going to be featured in a lot of YouTube channels, lot of guest posts, lot of partnerships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'ll see a lot of stuff in coming weeks and months. Good.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Good. Do you have, have a sense of who that ideal customer is? Who, where do you think that\'s leading you</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> right now? There are two personas which we are kind of targeting. One is the agency freelancer market who are developing site for clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that\'s, I, we have got several of those and those guys are like, Really, really happy with the product because it, it gives them like, kind of it empowers them, in fact to, to create WordPress sites without thinking about the underlying infrastructure. And they can, they invite their team, they can invite contractors, they can do a lot of stuff, which they, they would have been doing it, but with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Connecting several pieces and then creating some something of their own right. And second person persona is the [00:26:00] product. Develop developers, the, the, the plugin and theme authors out there who are developing products. So those guys are like, those folks are using for sandboxes for their data integration their staging testing of their plugins before releasing them, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Things like that. So these are the two personas which we are targeting right now. Yeah,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> that, that makes a lot of sense. It\'s, it\'s very familiar from, for anyone who\'s, who\'s worked with, with something like local before but you\'re actually working live in the browser very. With a very quick response.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, that\'s, I can see the educational purposes too for for opening, opening up WordPress development in general for for people who are new to it or, or trying to to learn or say Bringing in software engineers who, who maybe have less familiarity with WordPress and just, you know, quickly, quickly picking Yep.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Picking things up. Are you seeing that at all too? Any interest from the, [00:27:00] from project itself or, or others who are, who are doing training?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Yeah. So we have few folks who are doing trainings and education piece both free and paid. So we have got a lot of like non-profits and schools who are using this like a simple WordPress because they don\'t care about the underlying frustrated all the need is a WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. Right. So, and that, that is where we excel and obviously there are a couple of educators who are using this as a. Engagement. So they share like a hidden shared link of their sandbox. So they use that sandbox feature wherein they, they can say that you get a ready made starter template wherein you can, And this here is your study material and here is your ready to go WordPress template, and then you can start from there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right? So we have got like Jamie from Poodle Press and other folks who are using this as a, as, as an educated tool. So that is something That\'s great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. And being able to collaboratively edit work on code that seems like that would open up [00:28:00] all, all kinds of possibilities for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Onboarding new developers teaching teaching people who have haven\'t seen this before at all. Well that\'s, that\'s really great. Is there anything else we should look at or that you\'d like to. To cover it might be of interest to post status members and, and others in the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Yeah, Miss our vision is actually really, really big.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know whether we will be able to achieve it, but we\'ll obviously do our best. Though this is step number one, right, to create a cloud or create some kind of infrastructure wherein you get a WordPress site. Step number two will be once we have all the agency, all the freelances the agency owners and the developers on board.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And when we have like a hundred thousand plus users. We will have, we can have actually a marketplace because these, these guys are actually service providers, right? All these folks are service providers. And then when we bring in DIYers who are actually biased, even these, these folks can be biased among themselves, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So let\'s say [00:29:00] a, a person is offering their services like they do on Upwork. We can create such kind of platform on top of instead wp, right? So they, now Dan Orka can offer their services. They can offer their ready met templates, which they have worked on. Let\'s say they, I\'m a designer, I can create a really nice gym training template and then I can offer that for 30 bucks a pop or maybe like a, Something like a theme forest on the steroids, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So Uhhuh something, right? So like a template store and then you can sell basically is a marketplace for buying and selling. So that will be step number two. Step number three will be means creating completely like a. Vs. Or a web flow kind of environment where you get a starter template, which is connected to somebody else\'s hosting account.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it becomes like a WordPress as a service at that point. So let\'s say you have some [00:30:00] clients you can have, you can connect your WP Engine account within inta and anytime somebody requests a website from you, you can actually give them a link of your store Sure. Of, of your INTA store link, right? And they then they can go and they can buy a website.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which is actually internally hosted on your WP Engine account. Right. And everything is automated, right? So, So that will be like the biggest thing. So these things are like, it\'ll take months and years, but we\'ll get there. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Oh. Tell me a little bit about the cooperation with Blog Vault. You, that\'s, that they\'re providing the the ability to export quickly to, Wow.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It looked like, it looked like there were over a dozen hosting providers that Right. That they can connect you with. How did how did that relationship come about and, and how are you working together there? That\'s. I imagine that\'s done. Brought them a, a lot of a lot of activity, a lot of users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> Yeah, so Blog World is already pretty famous, so, but, and their product is [00:31:00] really robust and that\'s why we have, we integrated with them, right? So we do like a native integration where you click on migrate and then it shows up like 12, 15 options where you can migrate to however, in coming weeks, as I, as I told you earlier, that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We are coming up with our own Connect Connect plugin wherein you can connect your hosting account, you can your ok, any WebPress site on, on the internet and they can, you can push even, even easier, right? So the biggest problem which we are trying to solve is pushing. It changes. So let\'s say you created a staging site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You like, let\'s say you. Edit it. Couple of posts. Couple of pages. You installed a plugin, you did some s right? But when you push from staging to production, there is no good product right now on the market. Who can, who can re, who can recognize these changes? Right. The, the, the I creative changes and then push it like a GitHub, like a get come at.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>To the production site. Right. So that is something, is something we are researching on internally and we are very, I think we are positive on [00:32:00] that. So once we solve that, it\'ll become a game changer. Right. So you don\'t need to touch your production site. All changes will be done on Insta. Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Well, very nice.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, well, well thank you for the, for the tour. appreciate that. Best of luck to you and thank you. It\'s exciting to see, see it grow so, so quickly and</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Vikas Singhal:</strong> so well. No, thank you for listening to it patiently, and thank you for having me. Thanks.</p>\n<p>This article was published at Post Status — the community for WordPress professionals.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Nov 2022 04:21:19 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:10:\"Dan Knauss\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:74:\"WPTavern: WP Rankings Helps Plugin Developers Track Growth and Competitors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:30:\"https://wptavern.com/?p=139125\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:85:\"https://wptavern.com/wp-rankings-helps-plugin-developers-track-growth-and-competitors\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5056:\"<p>Last month, WordPress.org <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-org-removes-active-install-growth-data-for-plugins\">removed the active install growth chart from plugins</a>, upsetting plugin authors and leaving them with very little meaningful data. The Meta team is working on making more accurate and useful data available to plugin developers, but this will take some work. In the meantime, the team behind <a href=\"https://ayecode.io/\">AyeCode</a>, makers of the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/geodirectory/\">GeoDirectory plugin</a>, has created a tool to help plugin developers get an idea of how their plugins are ranking.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The popular plugin list is still there (and hopefully, it won&#8217;t be removed or altered),&#8221; AyeCode co-founder Paolo Tajani <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511#comment:77\">commented</a> on the <a href=\"https://meta.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/6511\">ticket</a> that requests the active install growth charts be restored. &#8220;As far as I know, active install count is the only ranking factor of the popular plugin list. I know it is not ideal, but it is what it is, and that is all we have.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Because wp.org only shows 99 pages (the first 1980 plugins), we quickly built a site to provide those basic stats to all plugin authors.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>AyeCode&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wp-rankings.com/\">WP Rankings</a> website launched one week after the active install growth chart data was pulled. It shows if a plugin is ranking higher or lower than the day before and how many positions it needs to climb to reach the next milestone. The homepage shows the &#8220;top 50 ranking climbers&#8221; of the day, and these can be filtered by the number of active installs. All the data is refreshed daily.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>AyeCode built the site using the GeoDirectory plugin, the Blockstrap theme, and custom code to fetch the data from the WordPress.org API. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We also wanted to show how easily GeoDirectory can handle +50k listings with a lot of custom fields on a pretty basic hosting plan,&#8221; Tajani said. &#8220;Most Directory plugins wouldn&#8217;t be able to do that.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Plugins can be searched by tag so visitors can see how their plugins are growing compared to others using the same tag.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, Tajani said he keeps his eye on the <a href=\"https://wp-rankings.com/plugins/tags/business-directory/\">&#8220;business directory&#8221; tag</a> every day to see how the GeoDirectory plugin is doing. Tajani said the API offers enough info to know if a plugin is growing, shrinking, or plateaued. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the data in the rankings is taken from the API and some of it is calculated, including the trends, the number of days until the next milestone, the number of five-stars to the next rating, and the number of positions to the next milestone. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking through to the individual plugin pages offers more graphs/charts about their movement on the popular plugin list. The data  from the API is remixed in various ways to extrapolate insights. For example, the number of days to the next milestone is based on the plugin&#8217;s current growth trend.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The individual plugin pages display a 15-day rank change chart, along with 24-hour and 7-day trends.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>A review stats graph estimates how many 5-star ratings are required to reach the next level. Another graph tracks 15 days worth of resolved support threads against the total number of threads logged.  </p>\n\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n\n<p>The last section shows a list of the plugin&#8217;s  competitors and a summary of their rankings and growth trends.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>The <a href=\"https://wp-rankings.com/statistics/\">stats page</a> shows how many plugins there are for each active install range up to 5 million. It&#8217;s interesting to see that there are 8,071 plugins with zero active installs and 13,643 with just 10. Another large concentration of plugins falls within the range of 100-400 active installs and another between 1,000 &#8211; 2,000 active installs.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Clicking through on the stats page will show the specific plugins in that range. </p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Tajani said the next thing on their roadmap is allowing plugin owners to customize the list of competitors and adding the specific plugins they want to see compared against their own. AyeCode plans to keep what they have built with WP Rankings free indefinitely.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What we really wanted to do is show another statistical point of view,&#8221; Tajani said. &#8220;We know it&#8217;s not the same and we will receive criticisms, too, but right now it&#8217;s the only way to know if a plugin is growing or not.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;What we will do with it in the future depends on how much plugin developers will like the idea and what kind of feedback we receive. If enough people start asking for features that could be considered premium, we will consider it.&#8221;</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Fri, 04 Nov 2022 02:34:33 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"Sarah Gooding\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:25;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:95:\"Do The Woo Community: Supporting WordPress Contributors with Alain Schlesser and Carole Olinger\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:28:\"https://dothewoo.io/?p=73341\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:66:\"https://dothewoo.io/supporting-wordpress-open-source-contributors/\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:448:\"<p>We discuss how the ecosystem can support those who contribute to WordPress and ideas on how to grow this into something sustainable.</p>\n<p>&gt;&gt; The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io/supporting-wordpress-open-source-contributors/\">Supporting WordPress Contributors with Alain Schlesser and Carole Olinger</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://dothewoo.io\">Do the Woo - a WooCommerce Builder Community</a>	.</p>\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:7:\"pubDate\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:31:\"Thu, 03 Nov 2022 09:02:00 +0000\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}s:32:\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\";a:1:{s:7:\"creator\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:5:\"BobWP\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}}}}i:26;a:6:{s:4:\"data\";s:13:\"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";s:5:\"child\";a:2:{s:0:\"\";a:5:{s:5:\"title\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:110:\"WPTavern: #49 – Matt Cromwell on the Effectiveness of the WordPress.org Repository for Promoting New Plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"guid\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:48:\"https://wptavern.com/?post_type=podcast&p=138983\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:4:\"link\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:124:\"https://wptavern.com/podcast/49-matt-cromwell-on-the-effectiveness-of-the-wordpress-org-repository-for-promoting-new-plugins\";s:7:\"attribs\";a:0:{}s:8:\"xml_base\";s:0:\"\";s:17:\"xml_base_explicit\";b:0;s:8:\"xml_lang\";s:0:\"\";}}s:11:\"description\";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:\"data\";s:44500:\"Transcript<div>\n<p>[00:00:00] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Welcome to the Jukebox podcast from WP Tavern. My Is Nathan Wrigley.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jukebox is a podcast which is dedicated to all things WordPress, the people, the events, the plugins, the blocks, the themes and in this case, the effectiveness of the wordpress.org repository for promoting new plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;d like to subscribe to the podcast, you can do that by searching for WP Tavern in your podcast player of choice, or by going to WPTavern.com forward slash feed forward slash podcast. And you can copy that URL into most podcast players.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you have a topic that you&#8217;d like us to feature on the podcast, I&#8217;m keen to hear from you and hopefully get you, or your idea featured on the show. Do that by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash contact forward slash jukebox, and use the form there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So on the podcast today, we have Matt Cromwell. Matt is Senior Director of Operations and Marketing at StellarWP, where he provides marketing and business insights and coaching to burgeoning WordPress product owners. He&#8217;s also one of the founders of GiveWP, a donation plugin, which uses the freemium model. Having a free version on wordpress.org&#8217;s repository as well as a paid premium offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The wordpress.org repository is where you find yourself when you click the add new button in the WP admin. It&#8217;s a place where plugin developers can, if they follow the guidelines, hosts to their plugins. It provides a direct line of access to all WordPress websites, and is therefore a convenient, free place to host your plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In return, the plugins in the repository must be freely available by the plugin authors. In the past few weeks, the repository has been in the news. Some statistics were unexpectedly removed, and this has led to a conversation about the governance of the repository, as well as questions about whether or not the repository is still a worthwhile place to offer your free plugins, if you have a premium tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Denning wrote a post entitled, &#8220;WordPress.org is ineffective for plugin distribution in 2022&#8221;, in which he lays out his thoughts as to why he no longer recommends the WordPress repository. The battle against already successful plugins, low conversion rates, and the difficulty in gaining visibility are amongst the arguments that he puts forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after Alex&#8217;s post was published, Matt Cromwell posted a rebuttal entitled, &#8220;The case for the WordPress freemium model&#8221;. And this is the basis of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about Matt&#8217;s history in WordPress as a premium plugin owner and how his experience leads him to conclude differently. That the WordPress repository can be successful, given the right expectations and approach. He&#8217;s found using the repository to be an effective channel to drive the plugins premium tier, as well as a way of offering a useful free donation tool to the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s a fascinating chat and is sure to be of interest to anyone thinking about starting a freemium plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you&#8217;re interested in finding out more, you can find all of the links in the show notes by heading over to WPTavern.com forward slash podcast. Where you&#8217;ll find all of the other episodes as well. And so, without further delay, I bring you Matt Cromwell.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I am joined on the podcast today by Matt Cromwell. Hello, Matt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:19] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Hi, thanks for having me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:20] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> You&#8217;re very welcome. We&#8217;ve got a, an interesting subject today, all about the wordpress.org ecosystem and whether or not it would be sensible or otherwise to put your free plugin over there. Before we get stuck into that debate, though properly, anybody that is unfamiliar with Matt, let&#8217;s give him an opportunity to introduce himself. So, Matt, just give us a few moments of your time to tell us who you are, what your relationship is with WordPress, what you&#8217;ve done in the past in the WordPress space.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:04:47] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Sure. I&#8217;ve been in WordPress for a while. I would say about 2012 or so. Jumped in and started building websites with WordPress, mostly helping non-profit organizations, churches, educational institutions. Then ended up partnering up with my longtime business partner, Devin Walker, and he and I decided to tackle a big problem in WordPress, which at that time was how to take online donations.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so we created a plugin called GiveWP, and that was launched in 2015. That has catapulted us into our career, and has done really well and we&#8217;re really proud of it. So much so that we sold it last year to uh, Liquid Web, which is where we are now in the StellarWP brands. There, we have also just recently been asked to uh, take on a bit more. And so now Devin and I are both managing GiveWP as well as iThemes, Iconic and Kadence WP. So things keep getting more and more exciting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:05:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Thank you very much. Yeah, really broad and rich history there. We could have spent the podcast talking about those products, but we&#8217;re not going to. Well, I think we might do tangentially as a way of demonstrating different things. But we&#8217;re on the podcast today to talk about a couple of pieces which came out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I will link correctly to both of the pieces that we&#8217;re in discussions about today. But I&#8217;ll mention them both in turn so that those listening to the podcast could possibly have a quick read of them before they pursue any further. So the first one was produced on the 18th of October by Alex Denning over at getellipsis.com, and that piece was called wordpress.org is ineffective for plugin distribution in 2022.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then a few days after that, you, Matt Cromwell, wrote a piece and that was at mattcromwell.com and it was called the case for the WordPress plugin freemium model. And in effect, your piece coming a little bit later was a rebuttal about what Alex was saying. Now, if you&#8217;d like to outline what Alex is saying, you are welcome to do that. Alternatively, I could try and outline what Alex was saying, which would you prefer?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:54] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> I think you are much more fair than I.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:06:56] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay, that&#8217;s very kind of you. The long and the short of Alex&#8217;s piece is that he believes that by the year 2022, we&#8217;ve got to a point where, if you are going to be releasing a plugin, a free plugin, into the WordPress space, he believes that it&#8217;s now no longer effective to do that on wordpress.org. The article is probably about a 10 or 15 minute read, and as always with Alex&#8217;s pieces, there&#8217;s lots and lots of data and so on to back it up. But essentially he believes it&#8217;s ineffective for a variety of reasons.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One of them is that the marketplace seems to be dominated, in his view, by some giant incumbents. We&#8217;ve all seen those plugins before. If you&#8217;ve tried to add a new plugin through the WordPress repository, you&#8217;ll probably know the plugins that we&#8217;re talking about. They always rise to the top. And that&#8217;s largely because, Alex thinks, because of the install base that they&#8217;ve already got. Once they&#8217;ve got over a certain amount, the hump of a 100,000, 500,000 or 1,000,000 installs, then it becomes more likely that they&#8217;re going to be surfaced.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There&#8217;s also the idea that, in the recent past, especially since 2016, he makes the point, it&#8217;s much more difficult for new plugins to breach that number. So getting past a hundred thousand and so on is more difficult, which is compounding the problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then if you add on to that, the fact that the search functionality within the WordPress repository also doesn&#8217;t give the opportunity for new plugins to be discovered. If you go there and you search for particular keywords, his contention would be that it&#8217;s much more likely that the ones with the greater install base are going to be surfaced first. In other words, it&#8217;s a bit of a, an echo chamber, I suppose, in a sense is what he&#8217;s saying.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Given all of that, he contends that you would be better off spending your time, and I guess for time you could read money as well, elsewhere. It might be better to have social campaigns or Google ads or some other channel of distribution, outside of wordpress.org, and so your endeavors would be better served elsewhere.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex I hope that I&#8217;ve summed that up correctly. If I&#8217;ve not, pleased do get in touch and let me know where I&#8217;ve mistaken things and I will gladly amend the show notes as such. But that, broadly speaking, is Alex&#8217;s contention. And, a day or so later compelled you to write a rebuttal. Just tell us what your thoughts are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:09:26] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah. Generally speaking I gave some good caveats in my piece that Alex does know what he&#8217;s talking about, and he has a lot of data to back up his conclusions, and I still believe that strongly um, he has reasons for saying what he says. What compelled me to write a rebuttal were essentially a couple claims that I felt were potentially not as helpful for the WordPress ecosystem.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In particular, one thing I think that&#8217;s important of what he&#8217;s saying is that, he says essentially that if you&#8217;re serious about your business and you want to build plugins then you should do premium only, and not a freemium model. Like basically do not build a free plugin, build a premium only plugin. And I really do believe that is damaging to the WordPress ecosystem overall.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If we start to see an influx of premium only offerings it can be really harder for the common user because, we all know it doesn&#8217;t take one plugin to build your website. It often takes a dozen, or several dozen plugins to build your website. And if you have to go, and be purchasing them across the web all over the place, it suddenly makes WordPress not as optimal to deal with.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that&#8217;s one of the big downsides of his argument that makes me say, ah, I think this needs a lot more context and I think it needs somebody to say, no, the freemium model still works. And then I spend the rest of the article really talking about how I do see that the freemium model does still work and specifically that .org, while the active install count is significant, it&#8217;s not the only factor, and it is still possible for newer plugins to get adoption on wordpress.org. It just takes some savvy for sure. It&#8217;s not as easy as it used to be. I&#8217;ll give him that for sure. It&#8217;s not a situation anymore where if you build it, they will come. So yeah, the long and the short of it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:11:18] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So, one of your contentions is that it&#8217;s damaging to the WordPress ecosystem, if in effect there was only paid for plugins and everything that you wished to have on your website was a paid for plugin. I&#8217;m guessing that over the years you&#8217;ve built websites in which you have utilized free plugins? And some of them may be broad in scope, but some of them may just achieve a couple of smaller things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, there&#8217;s something to be said about that, isn&#8217;t there? I guess there is something about the community and about the ecosystem, about the expectations of what you are getting into when you install WordPress, which has this free model to it. I guess that&#8217;s an important component of the community and it would in a sense be a shame if the only things that you could have were paid for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I remember the day, probably going back about 15 or so years ago, when I was looking around for different models for CMSs that I was going to begin using, and there were a variety of them. And there was Drupal and there was Joomla. But if memory serves, there was one called Expression Engine. I could have got the name wrong there. And it seemed to have a very low install base.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And my perception of that was that was because it took that model, it had the model of, you had to pay for not only the CMS but I think all of the different component parts that you could bolt onto the top of it, AKA plugins, and perhaps that was something that stifled its growth. And if we look back at WordPress, perhaps the free plugin model is one of the big factors of its success?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:12:47] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> For sure. Absolutely. I mean, for us with GiveWP and I think many people could think, whenever I say GiveWP, you can also think similarly of WooCommerce, quite honestly. It&#8217;s really important to us that GiveWP is free, because a lot of non, all non-profits basically start from zero in many ways. And they are always very conscious about their expenses. And they&#8217;re in the fundraising space. There are so many dozens and dozens of paid fundraising platforms and they are oftentimes very expensive. So having a free option for folks to be able to start fundraising with, and do it successfully and effectively is really important.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I say similar to WooCommerce because it is similar, like a lot of small businesses start from zero, and they can&#8217;t afford to be paying for a whole bunch of different plugins, just in order to sell their stuff online. I do worry a little bit on the WooCommerce side that their plugin ecosystem has gotten so large that sometimes it feels like it&#8217;s harder to start a shop with just WooCommerce free. And I wish they might put a little bit more features into the free plugin. But that&#8217;s a whole nother podcast.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:13:59] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Okay. Let&#8217;s take a couple of different pieces of the wordpress.org repo. One of the first things that Alex talks about is the opportunity is quite low according to his data for converting people over. So let&#8217;s say in the case of GiveWP, he doesn&#8217;t cite GiveWP, let&#8217;s be clear. He talks about other different plugins and you can verify that by looking at the article. His contention is that really the conversion rate from the free plugin, if people install your free plugin, it&#8217;s somewhere between one and 3% of those people will be interested enough to go and explore and look for your, your website or whatever channel it is that you&#8217;ve got for getting the paid version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, between one and 3% of your users, and therefore that&#8217;s seems like a fairly small figure. And so the cost in terms of the support that you&#8217;d have to give on .org, and also the fact that you&#8217;re having to update it and maintain two different versions with different features. If it&#8217;s only one or two or 3% that are converting, that does seem to be relatively small, but your experience is clearly different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:15:04] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah, for sure. Now Alex definitely when he was trying to say which plugins have the benefit of being preferred on the plugin directory search. I do think that he would put Give in the category of kind of an elite plugin. Because he did say plugins with a hundred thousand installs or more that have been there for a long time have this elite status, and it&#8217;s hard to compete with them. And we do have over a hundred thousand installs. We&#8217;ve been there for seven years now. So I think he doesn&#8217;t put us in the same category. But nevertheless, I can say authoritatively that we are converting closer to 28% of our install count to paid customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I also gave some data on a newer plugin called Orderable that I&#8217;m also involved with on the Stellar side that just launched last summer. And honestly, it&#8217;s a low estimation honestly. If I really look at everyone who&#8217;s paid for anything with Orderable, it is closer to the 30%. But right now, in terms of active customers, it&#8217;s around 18%. So it&#8217;s converting much higher than one to 2%, or one to 3%. But even if you take that one to 3%, and you think about these large plugins like Elementor or whatnot that have 5 million active installs that&#8217;s 50,000 customers. And that&#8217;s significant regardless.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, I wonder what could account for the difference there, because Alex is one, two or 3% which may very well be the case in certain given niches, or given the data that he was talking about. I wonder how we account for the big ocean really between your 28, 30%, whatever it may be, and that much smaller percentage? Perhaps it&#8217;s something to do with the nature of the plugin itself, what it&#8217;s doing, what problem it&#8217;s trying to solve, and whether it&#8217;s more desirable. I don&#8217;t really know. It&#8217;s interesting.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:16:52] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah, it is interesting and I, I do want to get some data from Alex on the specific freemium plugins that he&#8217;s worked on, on that, in that way. I do believe that Vova at Freemius probably has additional data that he might share about this subject as well. I believe that on average plugins that use Freemius convert higher than that 3% as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that one I think is another significant data point to keep in mind. But I know from, I, I know Alex and I adore him, he&#8217;s great. And if I&#8217;m thinking the most optimistically about his perspective, I think it&#8217;s more that he would really expect conversion rates to be at least 5% or higher because that&#8217;s what he can get with organic results. That&#8217;s what he can get with CPC ads most likely. He just knows marketing from a larger perspective and really is expecting a lot more. So, if I&#8217;m trying to be generous that&#8217;s what I would think.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:17:44] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I wonder if there is something in that, maybe your company Give, in this case that we&#8217;re talking about is unusually effective. So your 27%, 28%, whatever it may be is not the normal. Which is obviously very good for the way that you&#8217;ve done marketing and way that you&#8217;ve pitched yourself into the repo.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m curious, and it may be something that you don&#8217;t know the answer to, what would have been the rate? Given the install base that you&#8217;ve got. So you mentioned that there&#8217;s over a hundred thousand and you may not wish to share the numbers, which is fine. What percentage would have been effective to you? In other words, if it had have been at one or 2%, could you have made the plugin viable or did it need to creep into the 10 and 15% kind of area?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:18:30] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Mm-hmm. Well, we did have other plugins at the time, freemium plugins. And truth be told, I was not analyzing their conversion rates very specifically at that time. We had a bunch of business reviews plugins. We had a really fun plugin called Maps Builder that had a free and a pro version. And my guess would be that the conversion rates at that time for those plugins were probably also a lot lower than the 27%.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But they were viable. So I would just be guessing, I don&#8217;t want to just guess, but I do feel like they would probably be in the single digits in terms of conversion numbers. And at the end of the day, yeah, we did retire those for the most part. The business reviews ones are still out there, but we&#8217;ve made a premium product to kind of replace those. And it&#8217;s because of the success of GiveWP. So even if I look at our own plugins that we&#8217;ve built, we did make choices to sunset products because they weren&#8217;t converting as well. So it&#8217;s not as if I don&#8217;t hear Alex, on his side of things because I have some of that same experience. I just don&#8217;t think the conclusion is that means that .org is not viable. I do think it&#8217;s more of a product fit type of conversation, a marketing conversation, and things like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Just taking a bit of an aside here for a moment. Everything that goes into the .org repository is by nature, it&#8217;s free. You can download it and anybody can access it at any time. I&#8217;m curious, you may have opinions on this, you may not. If you have a commercial variant of the plugin, so you&#8217;ve got two sides of the coin. You&#8217;ve got the free .org side, and the paid for, wherever you may put that, but you&#8217;ve got a paid for version somewhere else. What is the true intent of the free version? Because I could look at it cynically and say, okay, the free version is basically a channel for trying to sweep people towards the paid version.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then with a less cynical hat, I could be, it&#8217;s offering the kind of functionality that we can support for free. In other words, we&#8217;re doing an altruistic thing, for the community for free, completely for free, with no expectation. Maybe it&#8217;s one side or the other, or maybe it&#8217;s a little bit of both. You&#8217;re being altruistic. You&#8217;re giving away certain set of features and range of options with the hope that some of them will come across. But no expectation, you know, it&#8217;s fine if you want to use the free version forever. As a plugin developer who&#8217;s been in the game for a long time, I wonder which side of the fence you sit on, or perhaps you literally do sit on the fence there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:20:54] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah, I mean the way that things like this work is essentially that at a certain stage, once you start to get enough users, it&#8217;s going to incur costs, just to have users. So specifically when you&#8217;re doing a plugin, like GiveWP or like WooCommerce that is so foundational to the functionality of a website and so important to that website, it&#8217;s going to start to incur costs. And that is human costs. That&#8217;s in the form of technical support for the most part. And account services. Because the users are going to need support. They&#8217;re gonna want support. And in order to fund that support, we do have to have some sort of funding in one way or another.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So doing the free plugin specifically is in order to serve that niche, in order to serve that functionality with the intention then that we&#8217;re gonna need to fund this in one way or another, and we&#8217;re gonna do that with premium features essentially. But it, it&#8217;s always been our strong conviction that the free plugin needs to be very full featured. That you need to be able to do effective fundraising with it out of the box. Or else folks don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;re getting into when they go to pay for something. So essentially it&#8217;s not just a funnel, which in some ways I think that&#8217;s a little bit of the take that Alex is leaning on, is that is looking at .org as one of your marketing funnels.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Which it is, of course. But it also represents your best foot forward of what your product is supposed to be, and what it&#8217;s supposed to offer. And in business there&#8217;s very often this idea of try before you buy, or there&#8217;s a free trial type of thing. With plugins we can&#8217;t do try before you buy really, and you can&#8217;t do free trials really, so your best option is to provide a free product that then leads to paid products. Am I answering your question?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:22:41] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah. That&#8217;s good. I know it&#8217;s a difficult tight rope to walk that one because, there isn&#8217;t really a correct answer, is there? It clearly has to be a little bit of a marketing channel. You are offering something in the hope of sweeping up a few of them. But equally, you are offering something in the hope that they&#8217;ll enjoy it and experience it and in many cases the functionality that&#8217;s there is sufficient. But should you wish more functionality, here&#8217;s the option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s an interesting thing as well that in the community, the whole promotional piece on the .org side is, I think, widely viewed with disdain. That is to say it doesn&#8217;t take much for a plugin author to completely derail their plugin if they abuse the UI that they&#8217;ve got for their plugin. I&#8217;m thinking here of examples in the past where companies have taken the opportunity to fill up portions of the screen with advertising for the paid version and so on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, we can see that the community really do feel quite strongly about this. From the plugin side, obviously, the author&#8217;s side, you wish to promote your own products because you want to stay in business. From the user&#8217;s side, there seems to be a groundswell of people who think that the repository version needs to be completely without any upsell features. It&#8217;s just, if it&#8217;s good enough, we&#8217;ll figure that out for ourselves and we&#8217;ll go and discover it for ourselves.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In terms of discovery, let&#8217;s just move back to the piece that you wrote. One of the contentions that Alex has was that being discovered inside of the repository is increasingly difficult. The big incumbents of which you&#8217;ve described GiveWP perhaps is one of them, but we know the names of all the other ones. They dominate the search because of their active install counts, and Alex maintains that that&#8217;s a very important metric. In other words, if you go into the repository and begin a search, it&#8217;s quite likely that the results will skew towards the larger active install count plugins. Therefore, it&#8217;s going to be difficult to break through the ceiling of that, no matter how unique and brilliant your plugin is, just because it&#8217;s difficult to launch something and it takes a lot of time. You have, specifically on that point, your rebuttal is interesting. What did you say there?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:24:52] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah, the active install count is a factor, and the plugin directory has gotten larger. But the active install count is one factor of many of the way in which the plugin search works. And luckily when you&#8217;re working with a open source platform like WordPress, all of the code that creates that search is open source as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So folks can take a look at it and see exactly the way that the algorithm works, in complete contrast to Google, for example, where it&#8217;s a big black box and nobody really knows how it works exactly. But .org is actually pretty straightforward and relatively simple. But there are a lot of metrics that they take into account when they create that search. And honestly the title of the plugin is actually one of the more significant ones.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now that being said, if you are, if in your title of your plugin you wanna say something like Wrigley page builder. Page builder is a very flooded field. Things like Elementor and Beaver Builder and others do have a lot more installs already and they&#8217;re going to show up higher if they also have page builder in their title than Wrigley will.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean that you aren&#8217;t found or aren&#8217;t discovered. You might not be first. You might not be second, but you still have a really good chance of being on page one. Because there&#8217;s really not that many page builders on .org currently. So there&#8217;s still a lot of room overall. That&#8217;s kind of my biggest contention, is simply that the way the search works is more complicated than just simply the active install count. It&#8217;s also these specific tags that you use. It&#8217;s also the way in which you describe the type of functionality you have. Whether or not you have good support is even a factor. Like answering all of your .org tickets and things like that. Those all factor in. How recently you&#8217;ve updated the plugin factors in. There&#8217;s a lot of factors involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:26:38] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So you specifically mentioned the following things, which are thrown into the mix when you do a search. So it would be the title of the plugin, the excerpt, the description, the tags, the slug author name, contributor names, last time it was updated, compatibility with core versions, number of active installs, percentage of support tickets resolved, which is really an interesting one, and the average star rating as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there are quite a few things in there. I guess in a sense, having that knowledge could lead you to be quite sophisticated in gaming that system, and it&#8217;s no different really than something like Google where people spend, I would imagine very large amounts of money in some cases, really manicuring their SEO, but without that insight.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And they may succeed one day, they may succeed another day. The point being, they still need to jump through hoops. It&#8217;s not You go over to Google and suddenly you are a winner. You would still have to spend large amounts of time and money organically to break through the surface against, say, for example, other page builders. I presume the problem would be equal over there than it would be on .org.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:27:49] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. And in this way I think what Alex is speaking to a bit is that, in the past with the plugin directory, it really was easier. It really was a lot easier to simply launch your plugin on .org and you would get found in the WP admin relatively easily. And those days are definitely not there anymore. It&#8217;s not quite as easy as it used to be at all. But I don&#8217;t believe that it means that .org is now no longer viable as a distribution option, or even as a marketing or business option.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:28:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Do you believe that the search algorithm in .org, despite the fact that it&#8217;s going through these whole slew of different things, and I&#8217;m guessing that if you read the code, you can see how the waiting would be and so on and so forth. But, do you believe that the search functionality does need a tweak?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Are there other metrics which you would like to see thrown in? Or, indeed just different areas of the UI which may give a small but potentially important boost to newcomers, in a way that perhaps the current search wouldn&#8217;t? And, I think Alex mentions something like rising stars as an option. The idea that plugins, which are new, potentially, they&#8217;ve gone from zero to 50 in a matter of days. That&#8217;s, on WordPress, that&#8217;s a big leap if you go from nothing to 50 or a hundred in a short period of time, that&#8217;s really quite something. And so maybe there&#8217;s parts of the UI where compliments of that nature could improve visibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:29:14] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Absolutely, there&#8217;s always room for improvement when it comes to search algorithms, because they are highly complex systems, and they are so significant. In some ways though, I think, just even if the search algorithm itself didn&#8217;t change, but we were able to add things like categorization, being able to navigate down the directory through categories first and then search. That might be a big advantage right away.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Especially if one of those categories was, new. Something that was recently launched. There&#8217;s actually a really fun free plugin, I think it&#8217;s just called New Plugins, I&#8217;ll have to look it up. I&#8217;ll send you the link. But you can install this plugin in your website, and what it does is it adds, when you go to plugins, add new, there&#8217;s tabs in there that says featured and things like that. It&#8217;ll add a new tab, and it&#8217;ll just show you the newest plugins on the directory. And I think that&#8217;s really cool and I&#8217;d love to see that on .org directly.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:30:09] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> Yeah, that&#8217;s really interesting. You also point out that the, gaming is the wrong word, but you make the point that it is still possible given the way that the search is carried out and the results that are shown, that, as an example, some of your competitors, they seem to have optimized with use of their plugin name or the other things that we mentioned, you know, excerpts and description, tags and so on. They&#8217;ve managed to vault over you in the .org search results, because they&#8217;ve optimized for words, which are well, really important to you, but you haven&#8217;t specifically optimized for those.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So for example, nobody could deny that your plugin GiveWP is to do with fundraising, and yet fundraise as a particular word, you are outcompeted on the marketplace there. And also crowdfunding, which again would be an important part of what it is that you do. Both of those words, you quickly discovered you were not winning, and in some cases you didn&#8217;t even appear in the search results on the first page, despite the fact that GiveWP is really, that is inside your wheelhouse without a doubt.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there is opportunity, I guess it&#8217;s more of a sort of long tail search. You&#8217;ve just got to find what those opportunities are. Unfortunately, I guess we don&#8217;t have the sort of metrics that we have with things like Google Ads and so on and so forth, where you can see what people have been searching for over, over a period of time, in a particular geography, given different demographics and so on. You just have to do the grunt work of figuring all this stuff out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:31:35] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah. One other point related to that, that I pointed out is that your presence on .org isn&#8217;t only about the .org plugin search. It&#8217;s also about Google search because those pages all get found on Google as well. And so because we do have insights from search console and Google Ads and things like that, that does influence the terms that we want to be found with as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it&#8217;s not only about figuring out how .org prioritizes plugins, but also what is going to get found on Google as well, because it&#8217;s really hard for any WordPress plugin to beat the domain authority of wordpress.org. If you build a plugin they most likely are going to be on the first page of Google before you are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:17] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So the contention there is that the .org repo is kind of doing double duty. It&#8217;s obviously offering your plugin up, should it be found, to people trying to add a new plugin. But also Google itself is scraping the.org repo and surfacing in its own search results. So if people are looking for the same kind of thing over on Google, they may very well be pointed towards your .org page. Have I summarised that correctly?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:43] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yep, absolutely. In this way .org is just a marketplace in many ways. It&#8217;s a public marketplace for folks to find free plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:50] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I do wonder if the algorithm which is running behind Google, obviously complex and probably, took billions of dollars over time to be put together and is very sophisticated. But it&#8217;s not quite such a blunt instrument, is it? It&#8217;s not just taking data from a series of tags and descriptions and metatags and so on. There&#8217;s a lot going on. So for example, if I search for fundraise, Google is probably clever enough to figure out hang on a minute, fundraise is a sort of synonym for crowdfunding. It&#8217;s a synonym for donations and so on. So, we&#8217;ll highlight those results as well. So in, in many ways, it&#8217;s a little bit more sophisticated, and maybe the .org search could have some of that goodness thrown into it in the future. Albeit not with the same budget that Google clearly has.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:33:36] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah, absolutely. That&#8217;s also a real reason why if you do have a free plugin on .org, it&#8217;s really good to make sure that you have folks who actually link to that plugin on .org. Not only linking to your website itself but to your free plugin on .org. Because then Google will pick up, oh, when folks are looking for fundraise plugin, they actually are looking for this Give thing, that might not rank as well on .org, but it is gonna rank great on Google, because Google does figure that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:04] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> We haven&#8217;t really strayed into this subject, but I&#8217;m wondering if you&#8217;ve had any experience with alternative marketplaces. The only one that really comes into my mind is Envato. Where for many years they&#8217;ve had a kind of rival plugin marketplace. I really haven&#8217;t been looking at how successful that&#8217;s been going, many years since I last visited it. But the option for plugin developers to sort of, corral together and have a completely different space. But it feels to me that in the end, potentially you just end up with the same problem, but in a third party marketplace.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:34:36] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Yeah, and that third party marketplace has very strong priorities around the way it wants to be paid, and the types of products it wants to be highlighting. They are far more opinionated about the way all of the products there are found and discovered. And it is really for the, the bottom line of Envato.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think, honestly, that&#8217;s one thing that&#8217;s a bit of an untapped conversation is the significance of having what is essentially a marketplace being owned by a non-profit organization, like the WP Foundation. I do think that&#8217;s a significant conversation and the more folks need to be having and recognize that we&#8217;re not just really all fighting for attention from a LLC or some giant corporation. We&#8217;re really trying to contribute together on a public project that should be primarily influenced by a non-profit organization instead.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:29] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I guess the long and the short of this episode would be, from your perspective, is the Word Press repository perfect? No. Is it useful? Yes. And that perhaps is enough for now. Could it be improved? Another yes, but for now that seems to be, at least for you and your experience, good enough</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:47] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Absolutely. I think it&#8217;s viable. I think it can be very helpful and beneficial. It doesn&#8217;t have to be your, it shouldn&#8217;t be your only tactic. But it also shouldn&#8217;t be easily ignored either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:35:58] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> So just to round off the conversation, one final question. How do you view your efforts on the WordPress repository as against all of the other things that you do outside of WordPress. So for example, Google and so on? You may have data to hand, you may not, I don&#8217;t know. But I&#8217;m just wondering if, one is equal to another or if the .org side definitely comes in second place, or perhaps it is the primary channel of your sales funnel.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:36:23] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Because there are different types of freemium models, that answer will be different based on the product owner and the route that they chose. If it&#8217;s a free plugin with a pro version, meaning you have to uninstall the free one in order to install the pro one, their priorities are probably gonna be very different.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But in our case, similar to Woo Commerce, it&#8217;s a core free plugin, and any of the paid add-ons require the free version to be installed. And because of that setup that we have, and WooCommerce has as well, the free plugin is foundational to everything we do. We&#8217;re always improving the free plugin in order for it to be more powerful, more streamlined, and for it to be able to enable us to do more things in the pro add-ons as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So being able to really parse it between priorities, it&#8217;s almost impossible. Because for us, the free plugin really encompasses the whole ecosystem of what Give actually does and means for us as a business, and as a product for the users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:21] <strong>Nathan Wrigley:</strong> I&#8217;m sure that this will be something which resonates with a lot of people. I don&#8217;t really know which side of the fence the audience will be sitting on, but no doubt there will be some commentary. There&#8217;ll be people wishing to explain their reasoning behind this, one way or another. Please feel free to go to the post on WP Tavern, and leave us some comments there. But for now, thank you so much Matt Cromwell for explaining your position about the WordPress.org repo. I appreciate it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:37:47] <strong>Matt Cromwell:</strong> Absolutely. Thank you so much.</p>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>On the podcast today we have <a href=\"https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc\">Matt Cromwell</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matt is Senior Director of Operations and Marketing at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/learnwithmattc\">StellarWP</a>, where he provides marketing and business insights and coaching to burgeoning WordPress product owners. He’s also one of the founders of <a href=\"https://givewp.com/\">GiveWP</a>, a donations plugin which uses the freemium model, having a free version on the WordPress.org repository as well as a paid premium offering.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The WordPress.org repository is where you find yourself when you click the ‘add new’ button in the WP admin. It’s a place where plugin developers can, if they follow the guidelines, host their plugins. It provides a direct line of access to all WordPress websites, and is therefore a convenient, free place to host your plugin. In return, the plugins in the repository must be freely available by the plugin authors.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In the past few weeks, the repository has been in the news. Some statistics were unexpectedly removed, and this has led to conversation about the governance of the repository, as well as questions about whether the repository is still a worthwhile place to offer your free plugins, if you have a premium tier.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Alex Denning wrote a post entitled “<a href=\"https://getellipsis.com/blog/org-is-ineffective-plugin-distribution\">WordPress.org is ineffective for plugin distribution in 2022</a>”, in which he lays out his thoughts as to why he no longer recommends the WordPress repository. The battle against already successful plugins, low conversation rates and the difficulty in gaining visibility are amongst the arguments that he puts forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shortly after Alex’s post was published, Matt Cromwell posted a rebuttal entitled “<a href=\"https://www.mattcromwell.com/the-case-for-the-wordpress-plugin-freemium-model/\">The Case for the WordPress Freemium Model</a>”, and this is the basis of the podcast today.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We talk about Matt’s history in WordPress as a premium plugin owner, and how his experience leads him to conclude differently; that the WordPress repository can be successful, given the right expectations and approach. He’s found using the repository to be an effective channel to drive the plugin’s premium tier, as well as a way of offering a useful free donation tool to the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It’s a fascinating chat and is sure to interest anyone thinking about starting a freemium plugin.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Useful links.</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><a

Magne wants to start an overdue conversation about three big risks — and opportunities — for WordPress agencies: 1) A lack of spaces for professional conversations and knowledge-sharing, including professional events, meetups,  and mastermind groups catering to enterprise WordPress. 2) Successful agencies that use WordPress extensively with little or no community involvement whose work would benefit from enterprise WordPress peer networks. 3) An over-emphasis in WordPress agencies on short-term engineering solutions to the exclusion of long-term business solutions. What\'s often left out is design, user experience, and most of all the capacity to play a strategic advisory role in partnership with clients.  </p></div>\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer eplus-wrapper\"></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"yoast-reading-time__wrapper\"><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__icon\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__spacer\"></span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__descriptive-text\">Estimated reading time:  </span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__reading-time\">4</span><span class=\"yoast-reading-time__time-unit\"> minutes</span></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<p class=\"has-drop-cap\">As more and more enterprises move onto WordPress and digital becomes the backbone of modern business, we need to become more than developers and designers.

Demand for WordPress development has never been higher, and we continue to see bigger companies building their websites on WordPress.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Most clients know WordPress may not be the best choice, but they are starting to understand that “best choice” isn’t relevant.&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>At Dekode we are focusing on enterprise clients, and it\'s really fun when large, interesting projects come our way — because of WordPress. It is a real contrast to how it used to be when most of our client meetings were spent explaining why WordPress is a good choice. Now it\'s rarely discussed at all. Most clients that come our way have already decided that WordPress is the right choice for them. Even big public tenders call out for WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Most of them know it\'s not necessarily the best choice, but they are starting to understand that “best choice” isn’t relevant.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If a client in 2017 set out to choose a CMS and had the slightest idea of what they were doing, they would have a shortlist of three to five CMSs to choose from. The truth is that any of them would have been a good choice, and any of them could be bent into shape to suit the client’s needs.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-constrained wp-block-group has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2 id=\"h-the-paradox\"><strong>The Paradox</strong>:</h2>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>WordPress as a platform is putting us on the enterprise path.&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>But what got us here is what makes us irrelevant.</strong></p>\n</div></div>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-can-we-overcome-success\">Can We <strong>Overcome Success</strong>?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>With the traction WordPress has gained over the last 15 years, we see that more and more enterprise companies are opening their eyes to what we can do with WordPress, but too often it’s for the wrong reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For large parts of the WordPress industry, plugins, themes, and soon-to-be <em>Gutenblocks</em> are the fuel that keeps the WordPress snowball rolling. SMBs spinning up WordPress websites on the fly.&nbsp; The platform is really great at this because it\'s so easy and flexible. It\'s a Swiss Army Knife on steroids, able to adapt to anyone\'s needs.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Some of the best WordPress projects are done by agencies that don’t really care about WordPress or the WordPress community. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But here is the paradox: this success is holding us back now because the thousands of plugins and DIY articles and solutions generally aren’t meant or relevant for the enterprise market. This means that a lot of enterprise companies are building patchwork WordPress installations that may or may not scale, be secure, or actually work as a modern digital tool for solving business needs.&nbsp; As we build more and more functionality and options, we are strolling farther and farther away from the enterprise playing field.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the best WordPress projects are done by agencies that don’t really care about WordPress or the WordPress community. Why? Because they use WordPress for what it is. A tool that gets the job done, cheaply and effectively. But as the web gets more and more complex, some of these agencies don\'t have the people with the necessary skills, and we are seeing more high-profile enterprise clients with low-quality WordPress websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So we are putting ourselves in a pretty bad position at the moment.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the rising demand for WordPress experts, everything should be great. But the fact is that there are too many high-profile websites out there with really poor-quality work under the hood. And the reputation WordPress has as an alternative for enterprise will deteriorate as these solutions fall apart piece by piece.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Do we actually solve someone\'s business goal or a user\'s need? Mileage varies — a lot.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Even though we are busy discussing our tool and what it can and cannot do, some WordPress enterprise projects actually do end up with a skillful WordPress agency. But all too often, the decision of what CMS to build on is made after a lot of the important strategic decisions are made—or even after the design is done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Too often other agencies are helping clients with strategic decision-making, design and communication, user testing,&nbsp; conversion optimization, and digital marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When competing platforms can offer a full spectrum of expertise, it really doesn\'t matter how good we are as developers. If the solutions we help create don\'t deliver on basic user needs and business goals, where is the value to the client? But too often we are not in a position to affect quality and business impact. Most of the time we are missing the show by collectively taking ourselves <em>off</em> the playing field.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-is-wordpress-enterprise-ready\"><strong>Is WordPress enterprise ready?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>From a technical perspective, the answer is obviously yes.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a <em>people</em> perspective, the answer is much less clear: yes and no.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>For the enterprise, WordPress is still a pretty risky move. But not because there aren\'t agencies that can deliver high-quality code, security, and scalability. It\'s amazing what the best developers can spin up on WordPress, but that doesn\'t really matter if everyone but the developers understands how they are (or aren’t) delivering a positive user experience and solving the client\'s business problems.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>Imagine a way of doing business that is not about redesign loops and short-term decisions but a way to create sustainable digital platforms and deliver long-term value to our clients.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Today when we get a project brief, there are no technical reasons why you shouldn\'t choose WordPress. Subjectively speaking, it\'s probably the best CMS out there, for many reasons.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that doesn\'t mean that it is the right choice for an enterprise business.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of examples of enterprise websites that run on WordPress. Technically many of them are flawless, and some even look good, but do they actually solve someone\'s business goal or a user\'s need? Mileage varies — a lot.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2 id=\"h-the-secret-sauce\"><strong>The Secret Sauce</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Digital is becoming the foundation of modern businesses, and in order to stay relevant, it is not enough to be only designers and developers anymore. We need to develop our skills further and become business designers and long-term digital partners for our clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best solutions can be made when we take our WordPress knowledge and developer skills and use them to create sustainable platforms and design systems that align with business strategy, user needs, and digital marketing.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We need to hold ourselves accountable to a long-term perspective for the decisions we make and the solutions we create. To stay relevant, we need to understand success is the value we deliver — on top of the technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There are plenty of WordCamps, seminars, podcasts, blogs, tutorials, and meetups out there.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>To stay relevant, we need to understand success is the value we deliver — on top of the technology.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>But what they all have in common is that they are aimed at the mass market side of WordPress where price tags are low and scale is everything. This is fantastic, and it will keep the WordPress snowball rolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But why is there no arena for professional conversations around WordPress Enterprise?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why is there no knowledge sharing about creating value on top of the tools we create?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if we did business the same way we\'ve built WordPress? What if we leverage our biggest asset, which is not WordPress the tool. It’s WordPress, the community, the culture, the openness, and the inclusiveness. What if we create our own way of integrating our open-source mindset into how we conduct our businesses?</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>We need a WordPress mindset, a WordPress way of doing business, that enables value creation for everyone involved.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Imagine a way of doing business that is not about redesign loops and short-term decisions but a way to create sustainable digital platforms and deliver long-term value to our clients.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In my opinion, there are enough strong forces in play to keep WordPress as a platform enterprise-ready and relevant. But I’m not sure that matters without a better understanding and focus on how we can deliver value on top of the tools we create.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>My wish is for WordPress to be known as more than the most cost-effective, enterprise-ready technology. I want it to be known for a WordPress mindset, a WordPress way of doing business, that enables value creation for everyone involved.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-spacer\"></div>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-constrained wp-block-group has-theme-palette-7-background-color has-background\"><div class=\"wp-block-group__inner-container\">\n<h2>Help make it happen!

The product, which includes free and commercial versions, allows users to import/export XML, CSV, or Excel data and integrates with more than a dozen popular plugins. Since its founding in 2011, WP All Import has been sold with unlimited, lifetime licenses. The product has more than 12,000 customers.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a statement published this week, WP All Import explained that the company went with lifetime licenses from the beginning because most commercial plugins were sold this way when they started in 2011 and customers began to expect it. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some companies have had a rocky transition out of providing lifetime licenses, as the community saw with <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/delicious-brains-acquires-advanced-custom-fields-plugin\">Delicious Brains&#8217; acquisition of ACF</a> in June 2021. Although they assured existing customers that they would honor their lifetime licenses, a few months later on Black Friday, Delicious Brains began <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/acf-solicits-lifetime-license-holders-for-contributions-urging-them-to-purchase-annual-subscriptions\">urging them to purchase annual subscriptions</a>. For many companies transitioning away from old pricing strategies, lifetime license holders become dead weight, requiring support without putting revenue back into the company. WP All Import has found success with offering lifetime licenses for 11 years, but the company is making sure its new customers will be paying every year:</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>We are not making this change because because lifetime licenses are inherently unsustainable or support costs are spiraling out of control.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP All Import is a profitable business, support costs generally follow revenue up and down, and lifetime licenses for WordPress plugins are absolutely a sustainable business model.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>We are moving to annual licenses simply because we will make more money.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;While lifetime licenses work, annual licenses are absolutely more profitable over the long term. This is why you see almost every piece of software on earth now being sold with one.&#8221;</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>WP All Import is one of the few remaining companies that is still using a lifetime license pricing strategy. The company noted that over the past ten years, the budgets for WordPress projects have grown along with the quality of their software. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Generally, the response to the news has been positive. Some are considering purchasing lifetime licenses before they are no longer offered. One customer said he appreciated the honest communication but bristled at the notion that &#8220;people just expect to have to renew their software licenses.&#8221; </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;No,&#8221; developer Patrick van Kouteren said. &#8220;It is being forced upon consumers because it generates more revenue for the business selling it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Well, that\'s honest from WP All Import.

A founding member of the first Moldavian jazz quartet, and later the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Art_Trio\">Moscow Art Trio</a>, Alperin became known for his distinct and bewitching blend of jazz and folk music.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This release is the culmination of a months-long effort to <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/issues/43241\">improve the design tooling consistency</a> of WordPress&#8217; core blocks. That means blocks that were missing things like typography, color, and border support have been updated wherever possible to match the support included in other blocks. Design tools and their controls are also now more consistently presented, so users can intuitively know what to expect when customizing their blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: WordPress 6.1 About page\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress 6.1 <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/07/21/core-editor-improvement-deeper-customization-with-more-template-options/\">expands the templates options</a> available for site editing. Theme authors and users can now create page-specific templates, custom post type and post-specific templates, user-selectable custom templates for all post types, and taxonomy-specific templates for categories or tags.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With all the new block design and template editing capabilities, WordPress 6.1 has added more sophisticated content-locking capabilities. Block-locking can now be applied to all inner blocks in one click. This applies to containing blocks like Group, Cover, and Column blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: WordPress 6.1 About Page\n\n\n\n<p>Menu management has also gotten a big update in 6.1, with menu controls relocated to their own place in the block settings. The navigation block now offers new fallback options in case the block isn&#8217;t pre-populated with inner blocks. If the navigation menu is empty, the fallback behavior is to display a list of available pages using the Page List block. If there are multiple block menus, the fallback is to display the most recently created block menu. This ensures that users aren&#8217;t stuck and can more easily understand where their menus will show up.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>New Twenty Twenty-Three Default Theme with 10 Style Variations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>One of the most anticipated parts of this release is the new <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/\">Twenty Twenty-Three</a> (TT3) default theme. This is a new kind of default theme that bundles a curated set of style variations, instead of creating a new theme from scratch. It uses a stripped-back version of Twenty Twenty-Two as the base for a theme that features <a href=\"https://wptavern.com/wordpress-announces-10-style-variation-selections-for-twenty-twenty-three-theme\">10 community-contributed style variations</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />image credit: WordPress 6.1 About page\n\n\n\n<p>The theme is accessibility-ready and puts the spotlight on all of the design tools available in the latest release. It is basically a blank slate for further customization, with both rich and minimalist color palettes and multiple typography options. It will be exciting to see what the world of WordPress users builds with the new theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img />\n\n\n\n<p>Fluid typography makes its debut in 6.1. This feature is for theme authors but benefits users and site visitors alike. It allows authors to define font sizes that will smoothly scale between smaller and larger viewports, adapting in a fluid way to varying widths. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The best part of the new fluid typography feature is that it can easily be turned on by setting <code>typography.fluid</code> to be <code>true</code> in theme.json and adding <code>fluid</code> to each of the <code>settings.typography.fontSizes</code> with <code>min</code> and <code>max</code> values.

Ukrainian-born Misha introduced the work of jazz ensembles globally and is celebrated as a founding member of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moscow_Art_Trio\">Moscow Art Trio</a>.<br /><br />“Misha” further refines the site-building experience. Inside WordPress 6.1 you’ll interact with enhancements that continue to make site creation more intuitive while pushing your creative boundaries further than ever. Don’t forget to enjoy some of Misha’s <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCuh5oEm_jJ_jTcv8DmbLi2Q\">jazz piano</a> as you take in all WordPress 6.1 has to offer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><span>The third major release of 2022 is here. </span><a href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.1.zip\"><span>Download it now</span></a><span>!

Furthermore, WordPress content creators will enjoy a suite of new features geared toward improving the writing and designing experiences.</span></p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>This release includes features that many in the WordPress Community have been most excited about since the start of this project. Additional enhancements and improvements to the editor give site owners more control and easier customization while offering a more cohesive experience to users. A lot of writing-focused improvements are included in the release, because if you’re giving voices to the voiceless you’ve got to focus on folks writing the copy. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of my favorite enhancements are the refined ability to select partial paragraphs in a block; settings to keep list view open by default; and the keyboard shortcut to add internal links expanded to all blocks.</p>\n<cite>Josepha Haden Chomphosy, Executive Director</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-buttons is-layout-flex\">\n<div class=\"wp-block-button\"><a class=\"wp-block-button__link wp-element-button\" href=\"https://wordpress.org/wordpress-6.1.zip\">Download WordPress 6.1</a></div>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<hr class=\"wp-block-separator has-alpha-channel-opacity\" />\n\n\n\n<h2>What’s Inside</h2>\n\n\n\n<h3>Twenty Twenty-Three:<br />A fresh default theme with 10 distinct style variations</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>After introducing foundational elements for block themes and style variations in releases 5.9 and 6.0, WordPress site builders welcome a new default theme, Twenty Twenty-Three, that is powered by <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/design/2022/09/07/tt3-default-theme-announcing-style-variation-selections/\">10 different styles</a> and tagged as&nbsp; “<a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/accessibility/\">Accessibility Ready</a>.” These intentionally unique styles ensure users can apply a different look and feel to their site with a single click—all within a single theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/11/Style-Variation-News-1.png?resize=1024%2C601&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13843\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>New templates for an improved creator experience</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New and more refined templates now give site builders more control over the creation of their sites. In this suite of new templates, find a custom template for posts &amp; pages in the Site Editor. Create and edit template parts like headers and footers more quickly with a new search-and-replace tool and easily view your new site.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/11/Templates-News.png?resize=1024%2C601&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13818\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>Design tools for more consistency and control</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thoughtful upgrades to the controls for design elements and blocks make laying out and building your new site a more consistent, complete, and intuitive experience.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/11/Design-Tools-News.png?resize=1024%2C601&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13819\" />\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Manage menus with ease</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>New fallback options in the navigation block mean you can edit the menu that’s open; no searching needed. Plus, the controls for choosing and working on menus have their own place in the block settings. The mobile menu system also gets an upgrade with new features, including different icon options, to make the menu yours.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/11/Navigation-1.png?resize=1024%2C601&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13844\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>Cleaner layouts and document settings visualization</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>View and manage post and page settings with a better-organized display improving the use of features like template picker and scheduler.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/11/Document-settings-News-1.png?resize=1024%2C601&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13838\" />\n\n\n\n<h3>One-click lock setting for all inner blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>When locking blocks, a new toggle lets you apply your lock settings to all the blocks in a containing block like the group, cover, and column blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n\n<img width=\"1024\" height=\"601\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/11/Lock-News.png?resize=1024%2C601&ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-13824\" />\n\n\n\n\n<h3>Improved block placeholders</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Various blocks have improved placeholders that reflect customization options to help you design your site and its content. For example, the Image block placeholder displays custom borders and duotone filters even before selecting an image.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Compose richer lists and quotes with inner blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The List and Quote blocks now support inner blocks, allowing for more flexible and rich compositions like adding headings inside your Quote blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>More responsive text with fluid typography</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>For developers working with block themes and/or <code>theme.json</code>, <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/08/04/whats-new-in-gutenberg-13-8-3-august/#fluid-typography-support\">fluid typography</a> lets you define font sizes that adapt for easy reading in any screen size.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Add starter patterns to any post type</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>In WordPress 6.0, site builders could add suggested patterns so that when creating a new page, you did not have to start blank. In 6.1, site builders can continue to opt-in to this feature for not only pages but for any post type. </p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Find block themes faster</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The Themes Directory has a filter for block themes, and a pattern preview gives a better sense of what the theme might look like while exploring different themes and patterns.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Keep your Site Editor settings for later</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Site Editor settings are now <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/changes-to-block-editor-preferences-in-wordpress-6-1/\">persistent for each user</a>. This means your settings will now be consistent across browsers and devices.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>A streamlined style system</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The CSS rules for margin, padding, typography, colors, and borders within the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/block-styles-generation-style-engine/\">styles engine</a> are now all in one place, reducing time spent on layout-specific tasks and helps to generate semantic class names.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Updated interface options and features</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Updates include <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/styling-elements-in-block-themes/\">styling elements</a> like buttons, citations, and links globally; controlling hover, active, and focus states for links using theme.json (not available to control in the interface yet); and customizing outline support for blocks and elements, among other features.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Continued evolution of layout options</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>The default content dimensions provided by themes can now be overridden in the Styles Sidebar, giving site builders better control over full-width content. Developers have <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/updated-editor-layout-support-in-6-1-after-refactor/\">fine-grained control over these controls</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Block Template parts in classic themes</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/04/block-based-template-parts-in-traditional-themes/\">Block template parts can now be defined in classic themes</a> by adding the appropriate HTML files `parts` directory at the root of the theme.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Expanded support for Query Loop blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/extending-the-query-loop-block/\">New filters</a> let Query Block variations support custom queries for more powerful variations and advanced hierarchical post types filtering options.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Filters for all your styles</h3>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/10/filters-for-theme-json-data/\">Leverage filters</a> in the Styles sidebar to control settings at all four levels of your site—core, theme, user, or block, from less to more specific.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Spacing presets for faster, consistent design</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Save time and avoid hard-coding values into a theme with <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/2022/10/07/introduction-of-presets-across-padding-margin-and-block-gap/\">preset margin and padding values for multiple blocks.</a></p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Content-only editing support for container blocks</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to content-only editing settings, layouts can be locked within container blocks. In a content-only block, its children are invisible to the List View and entirely uneditable. So you control the layout while your writers can focus on the content. Combine it with block-locking options for even more advanced control over your blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3>Other notes of interest</h3>\n\n\n\n<ul>\n<li>6.1 includes a new time-to-read feature showing content authors the approximate time-to-read values for pages, posts, and custom post types.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>The site tagline is empty by default in new sites but can be modified in General Settings.</li>\n\n\n\n<li>A new modal design offers a background blur effect, making it easier to focus on the task at hand.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n\n<h2>Enhancing WordPress 6.1 Accessibility</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Accessibility is an integral part of the WordPress mission of fostering an inclusive community and supporting users of all types around the world.

possible without the contributions of more than 800 people in over 60 countries. Their asynchronous coordination to deliver hundreds of enhancements and fixes into a stable release is a testament to the power and capability of the WordPress community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>By release day, 71 locales had translated 90-percent or more of WordPress 6.1 into their language. Community translators continue after a release ensuring more translations are on their way. Thank you to everyone who helps to make WordPress available in over 200 languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Many thanks to all of the community volunteers who contribute to the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/support/\">support forums</a> by answering questions from WordPress users around the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If contributing to WordPress appeals to you, it’s easy to learn more and get involved. Discover the different teams that come together to <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/\">Make WordPress</a> and explore the product roadmap on the <a href=\"https://make.wordpress.org/core/\">core development blog</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>The WordPress Mission &amp; You</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress is software designed for everyone, emphasizing accessibility, performance, security, and ease of use. The project believes great software should work with minimum setup, so you can focus on sharing your story, product, or services freely. The basic WordPress software is simple and predictable so you can easily get started.

It&#8217;s a community that has always answered his questions and helped him learn, and has enabled his voice to be heard across the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are motivating benefits for Raghavendra, who has a vision impairment that introduces challenges to many of the things he wants to do. The WordPress community has helped him make some of his dreams come true. After chatting with others at WordPress events, about his wish to go trekking and running, he found he was later contacted by people in the community went with him to do just that.</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"534\" height=\"748\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-3.jpg?resize=534%2C748&ssl=1\" alt=\"Raghavendra training for a marathon in 2013.\" class=\"wp-image-13702\" />Raghavendra training for a marathon in 2013\n\n\n\n<p>He also found WordPress events a way to raise the importance of accessibility issues, share tips, and connect local communities so they can collaborate on items both within and outside WordPress.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Life growing up with an enabling family</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>A key asset for Raghavendra has been the support of his family as he coped with his progressive blindness. His sister took charge of teaching him important social and life skills, so he could navigate his country&#8217;s rigorous education system.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Those were the early days of technology everywhere, and nobody much was thinking about using it in education and day-to-day life.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When Raghavendra got his first computer, in 2004, it was a revelation. His sister taught him to use the internet efficiently, and he taught himself a few basics of programming. Soon he was spending 10 to 12 hours a day exploring the online world and learning about the web.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Discovering WordPress and blogging</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2006, he learned basic web design and began to sell website templates. His growing interest in search engines and content led him to WordPress. As the years progressed, his eyesight deteriorated. He had to relearn his skills and acquire new ones to compensate. When he could no longer see the computer screen, he learnt to use screen readers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At that point there was a gap: he had the same business skills, but he couldn&#8217;t apply them as effectively until he got comfortable with using screen readers.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"800\" height=\"534\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/4.jpg?resize=800%2C534&ssl=1\" alt=\"Raghavendra speaking at an event in Bangalore, India in 2014. Photo Credit: Two Feet To Fly - fLaShBuLbZz Photography\" class=\"wp-image-13790\" />Raghavendra speaking at an event in Bengalaru, India in 2014\n\n\n\n<p>To help achieve that, Raghavendra moved to Bengalaru, where he got a full education in screen-reader technology and took a job as a consultant in digital accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He recalls learning from that time that, in his words: “Some things are important, but one needs to let them go so that more important things can take the new space.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>During his stay in Bengaluru, he stumbled on the idea of blogging and audiobooks. On his 23rd birthday, he had two firsts: registering a domain and publishing a blog post. At first he wrote about things happening in his daily life, which initially got low responses. But when he started attending blogging and tech meetups, he received encouragement from fellow bloggers who complimented him on his writing style. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Using WordPress to publish his story, Raghavendra found a love for writing and this made him want to learn and understand WordPress much better.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<h2>“Writing freed my mind and soul from the pain and sorrow; it takes a person into a Zen state where one can understand their soul once they see their own thoughts on paper.”</h2>\n<cite>Raghavendra Satish Peri</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>There were still some ongoing challenges arising from his difficulties with seeing. For example, Raghavendra found coding was made more complicated. But he took it slowly, and he improved steadily.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He started as many WordPressers do, installing themes and plugins, and making minor changes to the code. Ultimately, he moved all of his sites to WordPress, and as he learned more about WordPress, he could help his friends and family more with their projects.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>After just a few years, Raghavendra had the skills and the confidence to build just about anything in WordPress, progressing from simple to complex websites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Today Raghavendra is a successful entrepreneur. He sees his life as full of promise. WordPress still helps him grow every day, professionally and personally.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>“There is always hope for tomorrow! Do not look for the light at the end of the tunnel, embrace the darkness, listen to the quietness, and feel the airflow. You will know that light is ahead even before you see it.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>\n<cite>Raghavendra Satish Peri</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contribute to accessibility and WordPress</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Another thing Raghavendra has in common with many WordPressers is his enthusiasm and involvement in the community. As he has learnt more about the software, he felt he needed to be involved with improving accessibility too. He started to help organize local meetups and conferences and encourages others to give time and skills to contribute too.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<img width=\"704\" height=\"500\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-5.jpg?resize=704%2C500&ssl=1\" alt=\"2016, Raghavendra on stage speaking at WordCamp Mumbai\" class=\"wp-image-13699\" />2016, Raghavendra speaking at WordCamp Mumbai\n\n\n\n<p>He follows software development closely, especially where WordPress meets accessibility.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2020, on learning about a global WordPress Accessibility event, he applied and became a speaker. His topic was <a href=\"https://youtu.be/bvgLjWCRfrQ\">Gutenberg Accessibility, A Screen Reader User&#8217;s Perspective</a>. His interest continued as a result of this event, and he wanted to be part of growing its audience and impact, initially through joining its dedicated channel on Slack. Eventually, he joined the organizing team for future events.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Helping run WordPress events brought together all of Raghavendra&#8217;s existing skills. It taught him a lot about what it takes to make an event truly inclusive, from captions and sign language to media players and more.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As his involvement has grown, Raghavendra has found it has become easier to source and use resources that make events and presentations more accessible. But knows there&#8217;s always more that can be learnt in this area, and encourages others to use understanding from events like the Accessibility Days in their conferences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Join the global WordPress Accessibility Day 2022 online on November 2-3, 2022.&nbsp;It&#8217;s <a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/\">free to register</a>!</p>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"https://wpaccessibility.day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"><img width=\"568\" height=\"173\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/wp-accessibility-day-22.png?resize=568%2C173&ssl=1\" alt=\"WordPress Accessibility Day 2022 logo in purple and turquoise\" class=\"wp-image-13783\" /></a>\n\n\n\n<h2><br />Sharing learning on accessibility can be a motivator </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2021, Raghavendra underwent his most challenging event to date, when he had a kidney transplant. To motivate himself, he started a website that focuses on accessibility and inclusive design. This prompted him to start an accessibility community to help fill the gaps in accessibility knowledge. Today, it is one of India’s largest online accessibility communities, educating developers and designers and training people with disabilities to build a career in accessibility testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<img src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2022/10/raghavendra-6.jpg?resize=680%2C790&ssl=1\" alt=\"Portrait photo of Raghavendra post his organ transplant, 2021.\" class=\"wp-image-13698\" width=\"680\" height=\"790\" />Raghavendra after his organ transplant in 2021\n\n\n\n<p>Raghavendra is also a keen user of the WordPress Gutenberg editor and builds all his websites using it. Though content creation and editing can still pose him difficulties, he finds the front end of the Gutenberg blocks very accessible. He believes in participating in the software to make it a better experience for all.</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\">\n<p>&#8220;I decided to live my life to the fullest and make my mark on the world. This thought keeps me motivated.&#8221;</p>\n<cite>Raghavendra Satish Peri</cite></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>After a successful transplant, he lives a disciplined life with a few restrictions. He continues to enjoy working in-depth in disability, accessibility, and inclusion spaces. Raghavendra hopes others will join with him and the thousands of other people who collaborate to make a difference.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Share the stories</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Help share these stories of open source contributors and continue to grow the community. Meet more WordPressers in the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/news/category/newsletter/interviews/\">People of WordPress series</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Thank you to Raghavendra Satish Peri (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/tarkham/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>tarkham</a>) for sharing his experiences for this latest edition.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Contributors</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Thanks to Meher Bala (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/meher/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>meher</a>), Abha Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/webcommsat/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>webcommsat</a>) and Surendra Thakor (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/sthakor/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>sthakor</a>) for interviews and writing this feature, to Mary Baum (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/marybaum/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>marybaum</a>), Chloe Bringmann (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/cbringmann/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>cbringmann</a>), and Larissa Murillo (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/lmurillom/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>lmurillom</a>) for reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The <em>People of WordPress</em> series thanks Josepha Haden (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/chanthaboune/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>chanthaboune</a>) and Topher DeRosia (<a href=\"https://profiles.wordpress.org/topher1kenobe/\" class=\"mention\"><span class=\"mentions-prefix\">@</span>topher1kenobe</a>) for their support.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-media-text is-stacked-on-mobile is-vertically-aligned-center\"><img width=\"180\" height=\"135\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/wordpress.org/news/files/2020/03/heropress_logo_180.png?resize=180%2C135&ssl=1\" alt=\"HeroPress logo\" class=\"wp-image-8409 size-full\" /><div class=\"wp-block-media-text__content\">\n<p class=\"has-small-font-size\"><em>This People of WordPress feature is inspired by an essay originally published on </em><a href=\"https://heropress.com/\"><em>HeroPress.com</em></a><em>, a community initiative created by Topher DeRosia.

And welcome to the WordPress Briefing, a podcast where I&#8217;m normally very serious, but today is Halloween! And gosh, do I love a chance to celebrate. So today, the most serious thing I have is this WordPress themed Halloween Madlib for you. I&#8217;m your host, Josepha Haden Chomphosy. Here we go.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:00:43]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I was so excited to learn that WordCamp would be on Halloween this year, and now it&#8217;s finally here. After a full day of workshops and mingling, I am exhausted. But I&#8217;ve got just enough time to return to the hotel and prepare for the after party. It&#8217;s a themed costume event organized by the Docs team, and I cannot wait.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking into my room, I give a big yawn and realize just how tired I am. The bed is looking extra comfortable right now. Surely a little nap wouldn&#8217;t hurt, right? As soon as my head hits the pillow, I&#8217;m out like a light, but almost immediately, my eyes snap back open, a flash of lightning lights up the room, and I hear rain pouring down outside.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:01:23]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>After another flash, the lights in the room start to flicker. That&#8217;s strange, I think to myself, but I have an after party to get to. There must have been a power surge because when I look back at the clock, it&#8217;s reset and flashing 12:00 am. I check my phone, but it&#8217;s dead too. I&#8217;m not quite sure how long I&#8217;ve been sleeping, so I don&#8217;t know if I have enough time to change into my full Ninja Turtles costume.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just put the mask on and head down to the lobby to meet my WordPress friends. When the elevator dings open in the lobby, it&#8217;s completely empty. No concierge, no hotel staff, and no WordPress friends. That&#8217;s weird. The lights also seem dimmer. And, are those urgent Trac tickets on the lobby lounge chairs?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m wondering where everybody is, but I keep walking toward the convention hall. A shadow suddenly moves in the corner of my eye, and I spin around but only see my own face reflecting in a hallway mirror. Hmm, that&#8217;s odd. I notice that the cute Ninja Turtle mask looks a little less cute somehow. The eyes are angry red, and the teeth are now sharp-looking fangs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:02:33]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before I can take off the mask for a closer look, I see another shadow move in the corner of the mirror. When I turn around this time, I see the faint outline of a person. It looks familiar. Could that be Matt Mullenweg? Darn it. They disappear into the convention hall before I can even call out, ‘howdy!’ And so I break into a jog to follow after them.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Walking into the hall, I can hear the musical stylings of WordPress Jazzer Duke Ellington playing on a gramophone. I bob my head to the music, super relieved to see the room full of WordPressers dressed up and dancing. I head over to some of the folks from my Make team to chat, but oddly, they won&#8217;t stop dancing. They&#8217;re smiling and dancing and cheering each other on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of them are even doing the electric slide. It&#8217;s actually kind of impressive, but it&#8217;s still a little strange that no one will stop dancing to talk to me. Actually, now that I think about it, none of the party goers seem to be noticing me at all. Wondering what&#8217;s going on, I start backing up toward the door.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:03:32]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I jump a little as it slams behind me with the loud sound of an old door creaking and the heavy click of a lock.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when I noticed the shadowy familiar figure again. This time they&#8217;re standing by an open door on the other side of the hall. They seem to be watching me. They lift a white gloved hand and motion for me to follow before disappearing through the door again.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I run after the mysterious figure weaving between groups of dancing WordCamp goers. Could they be under a spell, I wonder while running past. I exit the convention space and enter a small hallway that seems to twist and turn. It feels a lot longer than I remember. I continue running through it and suddenly find myself back in the Contributor Day conference room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The shadow person is nowhere to be found, and as I walk around the contributor tables, I quickly notice that the exit back to the hotel has also disappeared. Okay, so this is getting really weird. My first thought is to get my Make team involved, but since they won&#8217;t stop dancing, I know I need to devise a different plan.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:04:34]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>That&#8217;s when I noticed the big glass box at the center of the room. I am almost certain it wasn&#8217;t there during Contributor Day. I approach the box cautiously. Inside I see a shiny silver goblet of gently fizzing WordPress blue liquid, possibly blueberry flavored if I had to guess. Attached to the goblet stem is a ribbon with a note in EB Garamond that reads: Merge Me.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>At first, I chuckle at the poor attempt at a GitHub joke until I spot another note scrolled on the glass in black marker. It says,&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Bubble, bubble, toil, and trouble;</em><br /><em>Find your escape route on the double;&nbsp;</em><br /><em>Bring back the community and one thing more;&nbsp;</em><br /><em>Merge the elixir with your core.&nbsp;</em></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As I&#8217;m trying to decode the odd poem’s meaning, a flash of lightning lurches across the room, and a clap of thunder follows behind.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:05:24]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I shield my eyes before looking up to find that I am no longer alone. It&#8217;s the shadowy figure again, except in the light of this room, I can finally see that it&#8217;s not anyone familiar. It is a lumpy-looking being, and it&#8217;s wearing a witch costume. The costume-clad figure looks very unsteady on its feet like it might fall over.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just as I&#8217;m about to ask if they&#8217;re all right, the person suddenly topples over into a heap of robes and broomsticks. I can see spots of yellow fur and a few pairs of fuzzy ears. Aha! There was a wisdom of Wapuus under that witchy costume.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They blink cutely at me for a moment and then quickly scurry into a surprisingly organized line. I watch, totally confused, as the line of Wapuus starts moving methodically back toward the convention hall. They take three steps, and then they turn to the side, take another three steps, and then turn to the other side.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last Wapuu in the line turns to look at me and motions with its tiny paw to follow. That&#8217;s when the words on the glass box finally click. I have to bring the community back. All the dancing WordPressers need to return to the contributor tables to break the spell. The Wapuus have started a conga line to help lead the way.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:06:35]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, off I go. Following the tiny conga line through the twisting hallway and into the convention hall. As I&#8217;m dancing behind the Wapuus, I&#8217;m happy to see all my fellow WordCamp attendees falling into step behind me. My steadily growing conga line is weaving its way through the hall, picking up WordPressers, wearing mouse costumes, and Frankensteins and penguin costumes, and that&#8217;s when the Wapuus changed their course, leading us back through the twisting hallway and into the Contributor Day conference room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>With the first part of the riddle solved, I&#8217;m glad to see that everyone has finally stopped dancing. Some folks are happy to sit down and get off their feet. Others are wondering how they ended up back in the contributor room. My Make team waves at me from across the room. I noticed there&#8217;s still no exit, but the glass box has disappeared. With the goblet free, there&#8217;s just one thing left for me to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>[Josepha Haden Chomphosy 00:07:27]&nbsp;</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I rush toward it, dodging Wapuus and a pile of kicked-off shoes. Except that the closer I think I&#8217;m getting to the goblet, the further away it feels. I run faster, weaving through people and tables, and just when I feel close enough to reach out for the goblet, I trip over a live-streaming cable, and I wake up in my hotel room.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sitting up quickly, I realize it was all just a very strange dream. Outside, the sun is setting in a clear sky with no storm in sight. I try to shake it off. I change into my Ninja Turtles costume, ready to do my best Monster Mash at the after party with all of my WordPress friends. As I walk out of the hotel room, I pause for a quick costume check in the mirror.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Before heading downstairs, I take a quick glance at the digital clock on the nightstand to see the time.

In today&#8217;s episode, we will talk about Gutenberg 14.4.0, upcoming WordPress 6.1 release, and what&#8217;s next for 6.2, and so much more. I&#8217;m Birgit Pauli-Haack, curator at the Gutenberg Times, contributor to the WordPress core team and documentation team, and WordPress developer advocate. And I&#8217;m here with Anne McCarthy, WordPress product liaison for WordPress open source project and triage co-lead for WordPress 6.1 release team. Good afternoon, Anne. How are you doing today? How are you doing?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I&#8217;m doing great. I&#8217;ve had extra coffee today and I&#8217;m very excited to talk about everything you have on your list. There&#8217;s a lot of fun and complex things happening that really help move WordPress in a solid direction. So we have a lot to cover.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And it&#8217;s going to be a great show, because it also needs to get everybody listeners kind of over the withdrawal that you will have. Yesterday, I looked at the calendar and realized that we will be on a November break almost for the Gutenberg Changelog. Work, travel, and holiday schedule is all going to interfere with our regular programming here. So I&#8217;m glad that Anne is here as my resident expert on all things WordPress 6.2 and we can talk a little bit about the future.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Community Contributions</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>But first we have community contributions, and I found a blog post by Artemio Morales who calls himself an electronic literature creator, and he has introduced us to his Gutenberg interactive fiction engine. So what&#8217;s interactive fiction? It&#8217;s software simulating environments in which players use text commands to control characters and influence the environment. Works in this form can be understood as literary narratives either in the form of interactive narratives or interactive narration, that so far Wikipedia.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>When using Artemio&#8217;s demo, all you see at the start is an image with some text and then three different links to continue that story. And depending on which link you click on, the story continues differently. So there are two paths. You go into the forest and then you come on two paths, one goes further deeper into the forest. Guess what happens now? Or you go down to the town and see how many people you see there. And these are the choices, and that&#8217;s how the story continues. Of course the creator part is coming up with all those different options and Gutenberg and the plugin that Artemio created helps you with putting the stories together. It&#8217;s really an interesting concept. And so he had some ideas on what you could do with it, and then you can choose your own adventure YouTube series for instance, or interactive comics or audio stories with branching pass, marketing or educational content, or even multimedia posts incorporating elements from all the above. So it was also interesting for me to read about the history of interactive fiction. So yeah, check it out. We will have the links in the show notes, of course.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, I think it&#8217;s such a neat thing that he&#8217;s working on and one of the things that I actually follow up with him whenever I saw that post too, because I run a side project along with a few other community members called the Museum of Block Art, where we create art with the WordPress block editor. And when he was describing and looking at the different interactive elements, I was like, man, you could really, the whole intent of the website right now is to have it be a virtual museum, and what would it look like to actually use this functionality on the Block Museum Site since it&#8217;s meant to be pushing the edges of WordPress and thinking really creatively. What would it look like if the experience of the museum itself was also pushing the limits of it? And it&#8217;s already using site editing and all this sort of stuff. But this would really, I think, take it to another creative element and make it a very, very meta kind of way, even more cutting edge. And so I&#8217;m hopeful that we can maybe get some functionality on there and demo it with the block museum as part of the efforts here.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: That&#8217;s an interesting idea. You kind of have different walks through the museums.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;s going to be really interesting. Yeah, I also could see that that maybe even be a story that is interactive narrative. Yeah, that&#8217;s a fiction and that&#8217;s posted as an art exhibit on it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: So a writer can put something. Well, there is the November challenge of the National Writing Association or so coming up. Maybe that&#8217;s something to look into it. Yeah. And you mentioned the Block Museum, we had just on the Gutenberg Times, you published a submission to the virtual museum of block art using tools and features for WordPress 6.0. What exactly are you looking for?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, so this actually ties in nicely with all of this. So part of one of the ideas for the walkthrough and interactive element is when thinking about going through a museum, one of the things that I love is you&#8217;re kind of walking through and you see how based on periods of time, especially in a museum with a lot of, maybe not necessarily modern art but more historical art, you see how the tooling changes and access to paper unlocks the ability to do this, or access to different materials becoming more accessible, suddenly everyone&#8217;s using a certain color or whatever it is, or they know depth perception. I think there&#8217;s some interesting elements there. And so one of the ideas that I&#8217;m trying to work on right now is thinking about the Block Museum over a longer period of time. So what was available when WordPress 5.9 versus let&#8217;s say WordPress 6.9, ideally the tooling and what&#8217;s possible for the creation of art evolves, and I think it&#8217;d be so neat to have release-based art exhibits.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I just set up the site super quick, because it&#8217;s WordPress using just a couple cray loop blocks, which is really cool. So there&#8217;s different exhibits. So there&#8217;s a 5.9 exhibit, a 6.0 exhibit, and now I want to have a 6.1, especially since so many design tools are coming to WordPress 6.1. There&#8217;s kind of an explosion of them, and I&#8217;m very keen to see what that unlocks in terms of art and the submission there. So I&#8217;m just looking for anything you want to create with WordPress 6.1. It can be before the release if you want to test stuff. I know the release is around the corner, and it can be anytime after leading up to 6.2. I just think it&#8217;s going to be a really, this release in particular, feels like it&#8217;s going to unlock a lot of creativity and I think it&#8217;ll be neat to visually show that at the museum.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, I think so too. And I&#8217;m really looking forward to what&#8217;s coming to the workers, to the museum as submissions because now with the be it the border control or be it the background or the gradients and all that, there are a lot of options to apply art, apply color, apply different forms and shapes that you can build with it. And there are some great examples already in the museum. So if you are not so creative and want to see what other people do, head on over to the blockmuseum.com. Is it a block-museum?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Block-museum. I always forget sometimes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. So these are the two community contributions today talking about art. I&#8217;m really excited about that because all of a sudden it&#8217;s away from making money or away from, oh I need to get my blog post posted and making products or something like that. Yeah, I&#8217;m really excited that we talk about it together. So what was released is the next section and…</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s Released</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, let&#8217;s dive into that. So WordPress 6.1 release candidate four is actually now available for testing. This was not published on our WordPress news site. Just kind of sometimes with release cycles there&#8217;s some additional RCs released candidates that are released right before just to make sure different high-priority bugs are addressed, but they&#8217;re not as necessarily major. So in this case I think two things were fixed. So you may not see it on WordPress news but know that it has happened and there&#8217;s now an RC4. So release squad is working super hard and behind the scenes to get final pieces in place and ready for the dry run. And then the final release is scheduled as a reminder for November 1st. And then Hector shared details about the release day process and earlier post if you&#8217;re a nerd like me and to know what actually happens.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And if you listen to this episode over the weekend before the release, it would be amazing if you could take some time to test 6.1. Brian Alexander, who is the, I think, test team lead and also the test lead for this release has instructions that make this really easy to follow. That will be in the show notes for helping test the different features of 6.1 and truly pick and choose whatever grabs your interest because it all helps. And I&#8217;ll do a special plug for any more developer focused folks, it would be great to test the typography as well as using block to put parts in a classic theme. And if you want to go even further, there&#8217;s a lot of stuff with filters for extending theme JSON and all sorts of things in the field guide. But I&#8217;m particularly keyed up around some of the developer features right now and getting feedback, even if it&#8217;s just like maybe you don&#8217;t find a bug but you find a way that would be more useful for you in the future. It&#8217;d be great.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And then definitely it holds through for the testing part theme and plugin developers, please, please, please see that your products still working for WordPress 6.1. Most of you are already doing that, but there&#8217;s always one out, maybe not. So I just urge you to start that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And with that, we are coming to the Gutenberg plugin release. It&#8217;s 14.4.0 and I&#8217;m pointing that out because, well this week first time release lead JuanMa Garrido pushed the plugin over the finish line and Michael Burridge contributor on core documentation. He pointed out that Johannes Gutenberg invented the printing press in 1440. That&#8217;s 1-4-4-0. So just a little tidbit there. I like these coincidences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I love that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Come together. Yeah. Mind you, it took about 144 plugin releases to come to this point. So that&#8217;s also a good number.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Wild, to think about. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. And before I forget, Michael Burridge is also the main creator of the newly released course on Learn the WordPress it&#8217;s called Introduction to Block Development: Build Your First Custom Block. And if you are a developer and found block post about getting started with block development not deep enough or too basic, you are invited to step to do the step-by-step tutorial on building a real life example of a block for the editor, from setting up your development environment, using create block scaffolding, that&#8217;s your official tool, to testing your first iteration of the block and also do some debugging. And as you work through the project, you will add configuration options that enable the user of your block to customize the look and feel of it and to the liking in match maybe a style guide. So this is a great course to get started with, and even if you have bits and pieces already in place, I learned a lot from it when I was going through this. So it&#8217;s definitely a worth looking through it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: It&#8217;s so cool to see that course out there. I think it&#8217;s going to be huge for so many people.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, and I think within the first week, 40, 50 people already took it and three were already through it. So it definitely fills a need there. But I got us totally sidetracked and I could even go more sidetrack, because there&#8217;s a second course in the Learn site that could be, that&#8217;s an advanced course. It&#8217;s about using the data layer of Gutenberg for others than the editors. So you can use it for your plugin settings pages or something like that. So how far off astray could we go with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Enhancements</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, let&#8217;s get back. So in the enhancements, there were two things that are developer related and I&#8217;m just pointing them out, because they might be important. One is the service side render has now a new attribute that skips the block support attribute. So there&#8217;s a little bug in the service side render when it&#8217;s pulled into the block editor admin feature, it duplicates the CSS. This fixes it, but it also adds another attribute to it. And this service side render function, or package actually, is used by 620 plugins. So I&#8217;m giving it a shout out here right away when it actually makes it in a good move plugin. So plugin developers can test it even already before it makes it into 6.2 or something like that. It&#8217;s a small change for most of them, but they might tap into that before that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And then the second part is that the great block scaffolding we just talked about that&#8217;s used in the course allows now custom keys to be generated for the block JSON file and the package station file. So the use case that kind of triggered that was that a feature that a developer wanted to use the ACF plugin for the custom fields and use the official scaffolding tool to create a block for it. But they needed to do a lot of manual adjustments for the right keys.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so that kind of got the developers working on it. And now with the variant flag and the no plugin flag that will come in that already available, and there is a dev note out there talking about that by Ryan Welcher. You now can use also the custom key to actually build ACF blocks with the official scaffolding block. And Ryan Welcher also has a three-part series on how to build custom WordPress block that supports advanced custom fields on YouTube. So that gets us another sidetrack here a little bit, but even if you don&#8217;t use advanced custom field plugin in part one, Ryan also walks you through how to retrieve and update post metadata while the block editor using the use entity prop hook and also shows you how to modify it so you can use it in the query loop block. And the field will then also display on archive pages. Yeah, if you want to start with create Block, now is a good time to learn more about it. And even if you don&#8217;t use ACF, the first video of this series will definitely be of interest for you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: There&#8217;s so much awesome work has been done around upgrading all these tooling to make it easier for people to get started. And Ryan&#8217;s does a great job of training these things and making it really accessible. So yeah, also if folks have ideas for what they want to see more, I know Ryan&#8217;s always open to suggestions there, too. So yeah, I hope folks dig in, because there&#8217;s a lot of good stuff there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Big props also to Grzegorz Ziolkowski and also Damon Cook who&#8217;s a developer advocate at WP Engine. They both also commenting on it and also pushing this release over the finish line or the PR and figuring out what the architectural approach would be. So yeah, good way for the tooling. Yay.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, very cool. Next up, we have a couple different items that are all in the kind of block libraries, so expanding what&#8217;s possible, or in one case restricting what&#8217;s possible to start the list block, which has recently been split apart so that you can actually have nested blocks within it and have inner block control. And what&#8217;s neat about this is typography controls are now added to the list block. So now that you have that support in place and that each list item is an individual block, you can actually customize the list so that maybe the first item&#8217;s bigger than the third item, or you have different coloring or you can do all sorts if you control each individual list item on its own and then add in topography controls, it really opens up some neat options for displaying your content. I already have a post that I&#8217;m actually working on, then I&#8217;m like, &#8220;Oh, I needed this.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I&#8217;m very excited to see it out here. I actually didn&#8217;t see it was being worked on until this release. So it&#8217;s another part of the larger effort to address and expand design tooling consistency, which is a really huge part of running the outreach program. Comes up a lot where it&#8217;s like, why can I do this in one block and not this in the other block? And it kind of marries the best of both worlds where it&#8217;s taking advantage of the list block being revamped to use inner blocks and including these tools. So I&#8217;m very excited to see that. I don&#8217;t know. Birgit, you write a lot of posts, too. Do you have anything that you&#8217;re keen to use with that?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. I can see that each list item can have a different font. Yeah. Or there&#8217;s some nice cool font that you can now add to your blog post even if you have a very neutral typography normally. So these things stand out and then yeah. But I like it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I think it&#8217;s cool. The next thing we have is block locking and adding to related to block locking. It adds content blocking to the navigation block, meaning the inability to edit the contents of the block. And if you&#8217;ll remember right now, currently for most blocks, you actually can only lock the ability to remove the block or lock down the ability to move it. So to delete the block or to move it. And this adds content locking, which is eventually going to be expanded ideally to all blocks to the navigation block specifically, which kind of matches the functionality of the reusable block. So it&#8217;s kind of bringing this functionality that you see that you would expect elsewhere to a really powerful high impact part of the site. And I can see this being really useful, for example, if someone has a classic theme, they adopt a template part to have a header, and then they&#8217;re adding the navigation block in there for someone to manipulate.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But let&#8217;s say you don&#8217;t want them to actually change the contents of it. You can actually use this new locking option as an admin to lock it down. So maybe an editor or can&#8217;t go in there and mess things up. So it&#8217;s just expanding that kind of support. And I think it&#8217;s a great call for folks who are site owners or agencies. It ties into larger efforts to offer more curation tools for the editor as well. And I&#8217;m really excited to see these experiments and to add specific blocking and very intentionally two different blocks to then get feedback about how that experience is before we roll it out elsewhere. So I think there&#8217;s going to be some good insights coming from that experience as well. So check that out.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, definitely. Yeah, if you look at the bigger picture of that, it almost kind of gives you similar functionality to the reusable block, but you can narrow down the content blocking. So if you have patterns where you want, that the content is reused over multiple pages, you can put it in a template part and the content is also locked and then have the same call to action in the footer or in the header of things. Yeah. So it&#8217;s a really good. 6.1 has a few of the things already for image blocks and also group blocks I think. But now coming into the navigation block is really good as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s great to see. Related to more tooling, the image block is now going to have a toolbar button to add a caption. So basically instead of it being something that to add and remove a caption, you&#8217;re able to just have it built into the block tool toolbar, which is a really easy way to see it at a glance. I&#8217;m very intrigued to see how this lands and what feedback comes up from it. I could see it being really useful. I wonder if people are going to be able to discover it pretty easily, because the icons, I think it&#8217;s a little bit like a couple dots at the bottom of a square. So I&#8217;m curious to see what feedback we have and what that looks like. But ultimately it should help people find the settings they expect in a readily accessible area. Yeah, and I know, Birgit, you were telling me before we started recording that if you add a caption in the media library and then you insert an image that it&#8217;ll appear automatically when you hit the add caption as well in the toolbar.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: It&#8217;ll automatically appear when you add the image to it to their canvas, then it shows the caption. But you can of course remove it, but when it&#8217;s empty you get the button up there. So you&#8217;re right, discoverability might be an issue there because it&#8217;s not always there. It&#8217;s only there when you need it, but sometimes you don&#8217;t know things that you need it if you don&#8217;t see them. Yeah.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yes. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But what I really like is that it&#8217;s now one of the efforts to make the editor look like the front end. And the image right now has always a little space on below for the add caption feature. And if you don&#8217;t do it just has a little more space there, and it doesn&#8217;t show you the front end. It&#8217;s not the same as you would see on the front end. So that&#8217;s why I think people worked on it and now we need to figure out what&#8217;s the best approach on the button and the tool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Agreed. Very. Especially as some of the work involves around adding a captions element too, I think it&#8217;s exciting to see all this sort of stuff being wedded together.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And when they manage how that works, the image caption, then once the feedback is in and there&#8217;s an iteration out there, that will be added to audio and video and also to table because for whatever reason tables have a caption.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I don&#8217;t know that historical reason behind that. I know that is interesting. Yeah, this is again one of those things where I think it&#8217;s neat where we have functionality we might want to roll out more broadly and instead it&#8217;s done in steps and kind of integrating from there. So I think there&#8217;s some good stuff that can come from that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Switching gears a little bit, this is kind of headed into the block intersection, and I am stoked about this feature. I have to admit that I was following this PR. So it&#8217;s introducing distraction free mode, and I was following this PR,, I was looking at it and I looked at it months ago and I&#8217;ve been laser focused on 6.1. So I hadn&#8217;t looked at in a while. I hadn&#8217;t used it in a while. And I was writing a post for this week and I was testing it out, and I was absolutely blown away by this feature.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So it really strips down the editor to the bare basics where the block toolbar is gone, the top toolbar also disappears, you can bring it back on hover, and it&#8217;s a mode you can toggle on and off. So I just think I&#8217;m going to be using this constantly going forward, because I write in a fair amount just rambling on my personal site. And I am definitely one of those people who doesn&#8217;t use necessarily a lot of images or have very complex content. I really do just tend to write pretty basic posts with just words and just let it fly. And it felt so nice to be in that editor experience where you&#8217;re not necessarily seeing all the plus signs everywhere. You&#8217;re not needing the block tool bar, you don&#8217;t need the quick inserter at all times. You don&#8217;t need the top toolbar visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I&#8217;m hardly using block settings. And instead you can kind of just free your mind up to focus on writing. And I did a quick video because I was so excited. I mean this was literally 11 o&#8217;clock at night and I was like, I couldn&#8217;t stop thinking about how good it felt. And I don&#8217;t have that very often with technology. I&#8217;m pretty critical with technology. So whenever I have that kind of feeling, I just put together a very quick, I think it&#8217;s less than two minute, video showing the distraction of free mode. And so genuinely this is something that I&#8217;m very excited about and I&#8217;m also so deep in the site editing world that I think it&#8217;s really important we pause and think about the core writing experience. So this is one of those improvements that I think a lot of folks will be excited about and saying that they can explore. It&#8217;s also very new. So feedback is very much needed and bugs will be found and we will iterate as open source does. But yeah, I could ran about this for probably a full hour. I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;re getting…</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m there right with you. Yeah, the distraction free mode is certainly something that I was looking into quite early when the Gutenberg editor came into WordPress, and I know that I tested and I wrote about it, the plugin that Rich Tabor and his teammate Jeffery Carandang put together, it&#8217;s called Iceberg. And that was a plugin that you could put on your site and then have distraction free writing, and it almost felt like a typewriter if you had the right fonts to it. And it really helped. I really loved it. And somewhere in the Gutenberg Times is certainly another is a review of it. But now it comes to core, and I&#8217;m really excited about it. I think the feature is driven by, of course we all put our opinions in there, but it is driven by Andrei Drananescu and I had a conversation with him, I said, &#8220;Well, we could even remove more.&#8221; And so I would go back to the classic editor without the toolbar, but I can see how that quite a few writers will actually embrace it and use it just as their editing experience and they go back to just writing and don&#8217;t have to be bothered up paragraphs or blocks or anything of that. Yeah, yeah. I&#8217;m excited to learn what other people think about it, and I hope they&#8217;ll write about it, and let us know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Especially before there&#8217;s a welcome feature. I think that&#8217;s the only concern. I saw there&#8217;s some follow up, there&#8217;s some accessibility stuff and then there&#8217;s also, wait, we need to actually tell people what this feature is. Because it&#8217;s a jarring different when you turn, because you&#8217;re like, wait ,where did everything go?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Is it broken?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, Yeah. It&#8217;s like wait, all my tooling went away. But I think once we get some of those requirements in place, it&#8217;ll be rocking and rolling.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, yeah, absolutely. And what&#8217;s also made it into this release is the redesign of the main pattern inserter. And the difference is that the categories show up and you click on the inserter and then use the pattern tab. What you see is only the categories of the patterns. And then when you click on the category, you see a preview of the patterns that are in there. And that is kind of comes also from some of the feedback that we got for patterns. So it&#8217;s kind of cool to see how that works. I find that inserter be a little bit too crowded when the patterns are actually kind of underneath the category and then I don&#8217;t see all the categories and all that. So it&#8217;s a nicer experience I feel about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Especially when thinking about scaling up the patterns and all the work that&#8217;s being done there. I think that&#8217;ll be a huge improvement to the experience of finding and managing all the different patterns that are now baked into a lot of themes.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. The next item is just a shout out for that the embed blog has now a variation to support the Tumbler dashboard URLs and of course with Tumbler also coming to use the Gutenberg block editor, it&#8217;s definitely good to have an embed block that can link out to other Tumbler blogs. The next one is toggle the navigation menu sidebar. And that&#8217;s an interesting development or iteration on the navigation block with using the sidebar to actually display the menus that you know from the classic menu editing, now you have a little bit more space to look at the menus and select them. Before it was a little bit cramped just in the navigation block interface. It&#8217;s a little bit, has more air to breathe. So check it out and see what to think about it. Have you tried it out, Anne?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: No, not yet. I truly have been so deep in 6.1 stuff, and I have tested some of the new UX management generally with the navigation stuff, but this is different. So yeah, I&#8217;m excited to test this out. It&#8217;s probably of one of the things I&#8217;m paying attention to for the outreach program, because once 6.1 ends, we can dig into the next call for testing.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Documentation</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right. Yeah. And then you have in the documentation settings, there are always changes that come with the release, but those changes are actually available on the block editor handbook right when they&#8217;re merged kind of 15 minutes later. But it&#8217;s good to have them in the release. There are two things that I wanted to do a shout out. One is the document, the current state of the layout block support. It explains in the architecture section and the style sections, how those block supports are supposed to work that come with 6.1. There&#8217;s also a dev note available in the field guide, but that has much more detail in it. And of course our show will share the links in the show note. And also for the extending the query loop block, that is a feature that comes with 6.1 as well. And a lot of people are waiting for that, especially plugin developers and agency developers because they deal with so many custom post types now they can control what the query loop is using as a query or the data that it&#8217;s using. So that&#8217;s published in the block editor handbook as well as have a developer note available in the field types. I&#8217;m really excited about that extension possibilities for the query block.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, I&#8217;m also. It&#8217;s amazing to have that documentation in place so promptly. I know we&#8217;ve struggled with that in the past. And so again, as always, there&#8217;s stuff that you&#8217;re missing that you want to see, especially with career loop stuff. As you mentioned, agencies plugin offers and they really need that there. And I know it&#8217;s a big one that folks have extended the Gray Loop block from Core. And so the hope is rather than needing to fully extend a lot of stuff, you can just use a variation and have what you need baked in core without having to do a lot of maintenance. So please check that out, give us feedback, let&#8217;s make it as useful as possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, it&#8217;s really important to kind of see what Core does in a once in a while, even if you have used or develop for the block for the last five years, because some of the things you can take off your plate that you don&#8217;t have to maintain it. it&#8217;s standardized and the Gutenberg developers and core contributors will maintain it for you, and you only need to look at your variations for that. So yeah, there are quite a few things coming, and I think it&#8217;s the time now that once the foundation and the developers know how everything kind of will work together with site editor, with a post block, and also with the theme, there was a lot of moving parts that needed to be together and come together before any extension would be feasible or extension features or hooks and filters would be feasible to put in. And now I think it&#8217;s the time where everybody&#8217;s kind of thinking about how can we standardize extending the block editor. All right. Yeah. Are we at the end? I think we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I think we are.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: At the end of the Changelog for the Gutenberg 14.4.0, and now on the eve of 6.1 release, the developers have already started to look at the next version and what can an updated tracking for various features that are too common. So you have been knee deep, if not year deep, into all the work and what are the highlights that you see coming to 6.2?</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>What’s in Active Development or Discussed</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Yeah, I know I keep getting the numbers wrong, which is just hilarious. Yeah, it is so exciting to see what&#8217;s going on. I really feel like there&#8217;s a lot of momentum particularly I want to call out attention to the title. The issue is Phase Two Customization. I&#8217;m pretty sure the number is Gutenberg number for the GitHub repo is a 33094 in case you&#8217;re a nerd and want to dig into it. But a lot of work has been done basically even before, way before 6.1 was out the door once there was feature freeze to say okay, what are we doing next and what can we do to actually thoroughly wrap up this phase two work where there&#8217;s a stable foundation, we can begin exploring phase three and what are the main tasks to do. And so there is that main issue that I mentioned that&#8217;s going to be updated on a regular basis going forward.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So a lot of work has been done to pull together the phase two customization issue that will be updated basically going forward until it&#8217;s closed. So I like to call it out. I know it&#8217;s tough to keep on top of GitHub and everything like that, but every once in a while there are issues that, especially overview issues if you look at the label for overview, that really gather efforts and if you want to pay attention at a high level and be a bit more involved and necessarily just paying attention to the next WordPress release, this is one of those. And there are numerous tasks, I&#8217;m going to give a snapshot, which is what I did yesterday in our hallway hangout of just kind of the main task where things are just because I think it&#8217;s interesting. Work has been completed on two tasks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dev work is underway on nine, we&#8217;re in the design stage for three tasks, meaning we still need to finish finalizing some design. Dev has been assigned but hasn&#8217;t yet started the work on three tasks as well. Work is stuck on one thing that I&#8217;m following up on, and there were three originally and got that down to one. And then work is stuck. I know to track this down. Work is stuck either due to a problem, like developers aren&#8217;t sure to move forward or design and development are going back and forth, or there&#8217;s been a time lapse of 14 plus days. That&#8217;s how I defined it is basically has there been a lull in activity, and there are 11 of those that are in that state. And so part of the work right now in the next week or so is to get that 11 number way down, get work going, get involved there. If you&#8217;re interested in contributing to the project, this would be a great way to get involved.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Lots of folks are gathering around this and as you mentioned at the top, there are a couple that I want to specifically call out of things that I think will be bigger than others to solve. So one is introducing a browse mode. And we keep using the word mode, which I think is misleading for browse mode actually. I think it&#8217;s more about redefining the experience of navigating in the site editor. So both in terms of when you enter the site editor, what do you see, what&#8217;s the first thing you see, and right now you&#8217;re brought into whatever is powering your homepage, and you&#8217;re placed basically into a template. And imagine instead you&#8217;re being brought into, still maybe your homepage, but the sidebar is automatically open so you can see how to navigate between things, see templates, see your styles interface. It would be in the same sidebar as this other stuff rather than shoved into the right hand side, which unless using right to left languages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I currently find that information architecture to be pretty confusing. The browse mode work is both about redefining the information architecture and allowing you to actually navigate between different parts of your site that you&#8217;re editing with more ease. Right now it&#8217;s pretty like you have to leave this, and enter this, and all that sort of stuff and this would allow kind of more fluidity and also potentially in time, part of what&#8217;s being done is bring back actual content editing in terms of posts and pages to the site editor experience and creating more pathways between all the different editors from the template editor, to the post editor, to the site editor, all that sort of stuff. So how can we bring this together to a cohesive experience and present it in a way that allows folks to navigate where they need and edit what they need in a way that actually is a bit more intuitive. So I&#8217;m very excited to call that out, and I don&#8217;t know if you have anything to add around that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: I&#8217;m totally excited about it, because I really hate going from the site editor to the post editor and have to go back, back, back and then kind of come in again and it looks like the same editor, but it&#8217;s a little bit different, and the tools are a little bit different. So I like that this browse mode or whatever you want to call it, will kind of unify the experience. And I know from the outreach program&#8217;s call for testings that there&#8217;s always a little bit confusion on are we editing now a page, or a post, or is the template of a page of a post? I think there&#8217;s quite some confusion around that, and it probably won&#8217;t go away because it&#8217;s such a technical distinction that the visual distinction is fairly close to nothing. So you can get lost in those two editing modes. So bringing it together at least in one section where you&#8217;re just going to switch off, okay, I&#8217;m browsing now. I&#8217;m looking at everything and then now I click and I&#8217;m somewhere, and then I click the edit button and then go back.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s almost like the customizer when you were using that to do some updates on the homepage with site title or changing where you also see where the places are, what you&#8217;re editing in the front end view. And I think there are quite a few hurdles to overcome with that, but I think it will make it class better than it is now with the two modes there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don&#8217;t know if the two modes will really go away. You always can probably edit the templates, but it&#8217;s definitely, it will help with the confusion.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: And I think even being able to see that you have a separate section for content versus templates, I think alone will be helpful. I think that&#8217;s part of what&#8217;s adding to the confusion. So I&#8217;m also very keen to test this. This is one of the top items I have in my mind for the full sighting outreach program. I always have a running list of things that I pay attention to. You would not believe my GitHub notifications, but this is one of the items that I&#8217;ve really been waiting for and wanting to see what we can do to get early feedback on. Because I do think it&#8217;s going to be a game changer, but with anything you implement, there&#8217;s going to be new problems and new confusion that arises in trade offs. So knowing what those trade offs are, and then making sure we&#8217;re able to push people where most of the time they&#8217;re able to get it right. That&#8217;s always the aim.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Right, right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Anne McCarthy: So yeah, that&#8217;s a big one to call out in that experience.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And we&#8217;ll share the issue number is 36667 just in case you want to rush to the computer and look it up. But I also see that the issue itself is almost a year old, so I&#8217;m also thinking that that was was on hold to kind of finish some of the site editor functionality before you can think about what would need to be in the browse mode displayed or how would it interact with the existing stuff. So I&#8217;m glad that there is some patience there with waiting on things before it&#8217;s released too soon or worked on it too soon when other things are not stable yet. So I really like it. I&#8217;m looking forward to it and see what other people talk about it. Yeah. What else?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: Ditto. Yeah, so the navigation block I have to call out and that is a big&#8230; I think we kind of do a disservice and we just talk about the navigation block, because it&#8217;s really how do you manage navigation for the entire site and the navigation experience for the entire site. And the block is one piece of that, and it connects to so much. And so there&#8217;s a lot of work from looking at, I was talking to Yellen this morning who&#8217;s a designer who works for Automattic, we&#8217;ve saw a lot of work with the navigation block around what if instead of directly manipulating the navigation block, you actually manipulate it in the block settings so you could actually drag and drop, and it was kind of more familiar to the old menu experience. What would that look like? And part of the work here is everything from that kind of stuff to how can you allow folks to have more control over the responsiveness of a navigation block item.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so there&#8217;s also some technical underpinnings around using different fallbacks and making sure there&#8217;s more fallbacks in place for when you&#8217;re switching from a classic theme to a block theme and making that as out of the box intuitive as possible. Currently there&#8217;s a really annoying convert to links thing that&#8217;s very confusing and not user friendly and very technical in some of the fallback situations. So there&#8217;s so much work to be done there. And I just want to call that out as something that I know a lot of people bring up as a major pain point. It&#8217;s something I hear about constantly. Did you know the navigation block is not easy to use?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Some people have other words for it, and I totally agree. Yes,</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I know. And it&#8217;s very interesting because I think there&#8217;s a split between both people who just want one navigation menu and it&#8217;s very simple and very contained. And then on the flip side, there&#8217;s people who want to create a mega menu. So I hear feedback about all sorts of things and I promise there are people working really hard to get it right. That&#8217;s another thing we&#8217;ll also be testing pretty extensively. And so I had to call that out. Another whole area of work as part of this wrapping up, phase two is around patterns. And so I like to quote Miguel, who is another coworker who said something like, &#8220;Up until this point, it was like&#8230;&#8221; I&#8217;m going to get this wrong, I&#8217;m going to butcher it. But he said something around, up until this point, it was all about blocks and now going forward so much is going to be about patterns, because that&#8217;s the way to really harness the power of blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And so a lot of stuff needs to be done around pattern categorization. We talked about the pattern inserter redesign and how that helps things be more scalable. But right now for example, there&#8217;s a category of patterns called query. What on earth does that mean? Especially what is that? And especially when that&#8217;s probably going to be the most commonly used pattern because the query block is an advanced tool. So why patterns should fill that gap and should make it really easy to do the basics of displaying posts. But people may not actually look into the query pattern, because that is more technical. So we need to do everything from revamping the categories to finishing up bundling the headers and footers so people regardless of theme, have easy access to those patterns. And reevaluating even how we show patterns from a theme versus patterns from the pattern directory and integration with the pattern directory as well. So there&#8217;s a lot of work to be done there across on numerous different things to really bring the power patterns fully into the experience. So that&#8217;s a huge, huge area of work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: But I think we pushed this quite far already with the multiple ways pattern can actually make it into the site, be it the pattern directory, be it with a theme. You can also put it in a plugin and say, yeah, I don&#8217;t know. And it&#8217;s so easy to bring something to a website that is already predesigned and then kind of feels like native to your own site when it kind of follows the theme. And I think that&#8217;s a strong suit from the panel directory that when you add them to your site, it kind of seamlessly. And I think there&#8217;s still some work to be done there, but seamlessly was with your colors, with your theme settings that it kind of picks up on that. That would be really cool. But for that you definitely would need more standardization on color palettes and font sizes and these kind of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it will always be mainly theme-driven, the pattern part. And that&#8217;s why I like that you can see the pattern now in the theme directory of the block themes. And also for classic themes if a classic theme has balance. Yeah, they also will show up in the block theme in the theme directory and yeah, I don&#8217;t know if we talked about it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: That&#8217;s very cool.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: We talked about it. Yeah. I&#8217;m just worrying, the speaking about the theme directory, what you also see now in the theme directory is the style variations. And when you click the style, they are now displayed underneath the screenshot. And when you click on that, the screenshot actually changed into the color setting. So it&#8217;s a really neat system that the meta team came up with. So try this out. It&#8217;s the first iteration, so it might not work for all themes, it definitely works for block themes that have style variations. And if you know that a theme has style variations, but they don&#8217;t show, please let the meta team know so they can fix whatever keeps the style of variations to show. It&#8217;s another kind of tangent. Sorry about that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: No no, it&#8217;s a great tangent, because I think it&#8217;s really important. It&#8217;s part of how can we show the power of the next generation of themes and actually bring that into the theme directory? Because that is a weird piece of this is evolving the theme directory as well. And it&#8217;s saying a lot of blocking authors have given feedback around as well as, hey, we&#8217;re doing all this work, this theme is so much more complex, it can do all these sorts of things, but it&#8217;s not reflected in the theme directory. So how can we bring that in?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it&#8217;s a really cool, which actually relates to the final thing I know we talked about, but retaining decoupling templates from themes and having templates be something that when you&#8217;re switching themes, you can actually retain them. And right now themes are tied to templates, so when you&#8217;re switching around, they&#8217;re basically &#8220;lost&#8221; or you can switch back to the theme and get it, but you have to bring it with you manually.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And that has been brought up for a long time. This has been raised as a flag. And I can imagine a future where you&#8217;re in the theme directory, a block name, and you still see those style variations, you see the patterns and then maybe you see the templates, and maybe you can pick and choose from each what you want to use. And so I think we&#8217;ve done some neat expirations around far into the future, blocking, switching and combining and merging and what that looks like. Obviously very futuristic almost, but we&#8217;re getting closer to that and that&#8217;s part of the work being done is improving the experience of switching from classic to block and then also in between blockings themselves. So yeah, lots of exciting stuff being done.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: And I like that we are now at the point where we kind of pivot from what we knew before, like template and themes and template parts. They&#8217;re all together, and now we are kind decouple them and make it user friendly, because you don&#8217;t want to put all the work into creating a template for your post or for your categories, and then you switch a theme and then you lose all that. So that&#8217;s definitely not what a user-friendly system would be, but it also adds a little bit, if not quite a big complexity to the system and to see what is what and where does it come from? Especially when you want to debug and you have to figure out where did the user get this pattern and where did the user get this template purge? And how is that same templates still there? Kind of. Yeah. So it&#8217;s going to be really interesting to see what happens next there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Well, thank you. Yeah, thank you so much for at least giving us a broad overview, and we will certainly share that phase two customization updated tracking issue and keep you up to date here on the Gutenberg Changelog. Yeah.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So this brings us to the end of the show and this was a great way to talk about all of it. What&#8217;s in WordPress, what&#8217;s in Gutenberg, what&#8217;s in the view, what&#8217;s in art and in fiction. So is there anything that you want to give a shout out to that we haven&#8217;t talked about but it&#8217;s really close to your heart or that people should know?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: I have something cheesy to share, which is we&#8217;re coming up on two years of when the first call for testing for the outreach program started. And I had a hallway hangout yesterday with a group of, I think almost like 10 folks. And I missed people. I&#8217;ve been doing this for two years with people that around the world who I haven&#8217;t seen. And I just want to give a lot of props to the WordPress community for engaging with these things. And a lot of stuff has just been experimentation and figuring out what works and what doesn&#8217;t and people being vulnerable and sharing and showing up. And I just was filled with a lot of gratitude yesterday thinking about, remember the first hallway hang out I ran, I think two people came, and no one knew what it was and it didn&#8217;t seem very useful. And now people come and really give a lot of time and attention, and then I missed people. And that&#8217;s a really wonderful feeling. And at the end of the day, we&#8217;re doing this for each other and for the open internet. So yeah, that&#8217;s just a cheesy way to end, but it just was very much on my mind thinking about how much it really is a collective effort.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah, that&#8217;s an excellent way to end the show. Thank you so much.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Anne McCarthy</em>: And thank you for all the stuff you do, too. The regular Gutenberg changelog podcasts are just excellent resources for people, so it&#8217;s an honor to be on here and have a chance to nerd out with someone else rather than alone in my apartment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>Birgit Pauli-Haack</em>: Yeah. Well thank you for, yeah, we have been working on this together for quite a while, and yeah, it&#8217;s always a pleasure to have you on the show, and thank you for spending time with me today and working us through that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And dear listeners, thank you so much also for listening to it. And if you want to write a review on iTunes or Stitcher or Podcaster or wherever we get it, and we would like to read it aloud here. So let other people know how you feel about the Changelog, it helps with the distribution. And as always, the show notes will be published on Gutenbergtimes.com/podcast.

Musk fired top executives at the company and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585619322239561728\">tweeted</a> an appeal to Twitter&#8217;s advertisers to share his motivation in acquiring what is arguably the world&#8217;s most important social network:</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The reason I acquired Twitter is because it is important to the future of civilization to have a common digital town square, where a wide range of beliefs can be debated in a healthy manner, without resorting to violence,&#8221; Musk said. &#8220;There is currently great danger that social media will splinter into far right wing and far left wing echo chambers that generate more hate and divide our society.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p> Musk also hinted at the importance of content moderation, saying &#8220;Twitter obviously cannot become a free-for-all hellscape, where anything can be said with no consequences!&#8221; The company is forming a council to discuss content moderation, but nobody knows what that will mean for the future of Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Twitter will be forming a content moderation council with widely diverse viewpoints. <br /><br />No major content decisions or account reinstatements will happen before that council convenes.</p>&mdash; Elon Musk (@elonmusk) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586059953311137792?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 28, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>While some Twitter users have considered migrating to Tumblr, the structure and user base isn&#8217;t currently comparable to the Twitter experience. In response to Verge co-founder Nilay Patel&#8217;s provocative article titled &#8220;<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation\">Welcome to hell, Elon</a>,&#8221; Tumblr CEO Matt Mullenweg <a href=\"https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/1586013950109310977\">tweeted</a> his support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;This is an unfortunately good summary of why running a social network is so hard, as I’ve learned with Tumblr,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;I am wishing Twitter the best and also hope this doesn’t slow down Tesla or SpaceX, which I think are critical to the future.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Patel aptly communicated the weight of the political challenges Musk will face in his commitment to steering Twitter away from becoming &#8220;a free-for-all hellscape,&#8221; which some think has already happened. If Musk decides to open the doors to unsavory characters who were banned in the past, it may drive the social network into the ground.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>While the WordPress community has many online gathering places &#8211; various Slack workspaces, P2 blogs, and Facebook groups &#8211; it has always been Twitter that served as the place for both casual interactions and breaking news. It is the de facto social network for those working in tech. There are many who only use the platform for keeping up with WordPress news and the community.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;There’s nowhere else to really go!&#8221; WordPress product designer Mike McAlister <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mikemcalister/status/1586003046399623169\">said</a>. &#8220;WordPress people are pretty much exclusively on Twitter it seems.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Apart from the few optimistic souls who think Twitter will be better than ever, many community members expressed apprehension about losing the network they have built over the years. As the closing of the sale loomed, people threatened to leave Twitter on principle if Musk gained control. That day has arrived, but for the most part the WordPress community is not abandoning Twitter. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Twitter has had too good of an impact on my life to just jump ship,&#8221; Edan Ben-Atar <a href=\"https://twitter.com/edanbenatar/status/1586009637203083265\">said</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;ll stick around for as long as it makes sense. For now, nothing has changed from what is noticeable to the eye.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WordPress designer Dustin Henrich says he is staying but also looking up the people he follows on other platforms. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve made too many good connections, enjoy reading about people&#8217;s tech and non tech lives, and learning from some wicked smart people,&#8221; Henrich <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dhenrich/status/1586017449287503874\">said</a>. &#8220;I&#8217;d truly be sad if this just all went away.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Decentralized social networking, which has so far failed to gain much mainstream attention, is getting a second look in light of Twitter changing hands. WordPress agency owner Tom Finley is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1586099982620594176\">experimenting</a> with using the <a href=\"https://wordpress.org/plugins/activitypub/\">Activity Pub plugin</a> to set up his site as a private Mastadon server. It implements the ActivityPub protocol for WordPress so readers can see the site&#8217;s posts on Mastadon and other federated platforms (that support Activity Pub).</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Some WordPress community members are flirting with joining Mastadon instances, or have already committed to posting in both networks, but we are not yet seeing a mass exodus flocking to the fediverse.</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I’m giving Mastodon a try although I’m still sticking around here for the time being. <br /><br />I hate to say it but what about more use of the official WordPress Slack workspace? I often go there if I need to find someone in the community.</p>&mdash; Shawn Hooper (@ShawnHooper) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ShawnHooper/status/1586040039473090560?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 28, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We’ve seen this attempted exodus to the promised land many times before,&#8221; Ross Wintle <a href=\"https://rosswintle.uk/2022/10/something-about-twitter/\">said</a> in a post that explains why he isn&#8217;t optimistic about people successfully leaving Twitter. &#8220;Without a proper mass migration of people and organizations to another service, it doesn’t stick. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;You end up with people cross posting to multiple services to reach all the people that they want to reach. And then as a reader I’m checking multiple services and seeing the same things. The signal/noise ratio goes down. And most people get fed up and end up back where they were before.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The most hopeful speculators ask if this could this be the return of blogs. At the moment blogs are not social enough, and there isn&#8217;t a critical mass of bloggers eager enough to adopt the protocols necessary to connect their sites in a stream of easily digestible, short updates. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Until Elon Musk makes more radical changes, many WordPress community members see no reason to leave Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For now, I don&#8217;t see a reason to leave,&#8221; WordPress developer advocate Birgit Pauli-Haack <a href=\"https://twitter.com/bph/status/1586069842553344000\">said</a>. &#8220;Block, Unfollow, Mute are my friends for curating my feed. I did cancel my subscription to Twitter Blue after 12 months. Being allowed to edit tweets is not worth it.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"wp-block-embed__wrapper\">\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">I\'ve been through so many social networks over time as they come and go. I lost count how many people say they are leaving Twitter.<br /><br />I use Twitter primarily for note taking, links, etc. I see nothing about that to change.</p>&mdash; David Bisset (@dimensionmedia) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/dimensionmedia/status/1586067272933654528?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">October 28, 2022</a></blockquote>\n</div>\n\n\n\n<p>Overall, most people are taking a &#8220;wait and see&#8221; approach regarding leaving Twitter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t found a viable alternative,&#8221; WordPress meetup organizer Sallie Goetsch <a href=\"https://twitter.com/salliegoetsch/status/1586042212567068672\">said</a>. &#8220;I do hang out in various WP Slack groups, but for the wider world&#8230;we&#8217;ll just have to see what happens here.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>One positive byproduct of this recent shake-up is that the WordPress community is considering a future where important conversations happen on another platform. As users explore other social networks, they may gain an affinity for a different type of social media culture with features that Twitter is lacking. Migrating and settling into a new social home on the web takes time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I’m not saying I wouldn’t love a mass migration to happen,&#8221; Ross Wintle said. &#8220;I’ve just seen so many attempts now and none seem to have been particularly successful, and I don’t see why this one would either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;For a big change to happen, I think either the platform has to spontaneously combust itself or it falls out of fashion by a long period of attrition and fades from the public consciousness over time. Facebook may even be at the start of this.

I applaud so much of how all of these things have simplified my life, and make my life so much easier as a disabled person. I use <strong>Ring</strong> doorbell to talk to anyone who rings my doorbell to let them know I’m on my way (but slow). I use <strong>Alexa</strong> to automate lights when I’m not home and voice commands to turn on/off lights, check the weather and news, and set my thermostat. This week I installed a <strong>Stream Deck</strong> to automate things at my desk like key lights, opening websites, and I even added a sound for podcasting fun. AI can generate copy for titles, tweets, and even site content.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But nothing surpasses human interaction. Being on a <strong>Zoom</strong> call for our Post Status weekly huddles, creative brainstorming with my <strong>Stellar</strong> team, one-on-ones with friends and family, and recording podcasts with my podcasting partners and guests all enhance my life greatly. And I appreciate interacting with so many of you on <strong>Twitter</strong> about <strong>WordPress</strong>, tech, and life in general.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation\">Changes are coming to Twitter with the new leadership there</a>.

That question may be key to keeping that mass market appeal from draining away to simpler, leaner SaaS alternatives. In an article <strong>Eric Karkovack</strong> shared this week in <strong><a href=\"https://poststatus.com/#choose-membership\">Post Status Slack</a></strong>, Eric has <a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/can-wordpress-appeal-to-diy-markets/\">some ideas for improving the WordPress user experience</a>, especially for DIY users setting up a website for the first time. </p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote><p>We all have lists of plugins we disrecommend — to the point that it\'s a dealbreaker if a client insists on using them. And of course, these lists change a lot over time. We all know these things — but it\'s a kind of &#8220;open secret&#8221; within professional WordPress circles. That\'s understandable! Comparison is the thief of joy — and possibly revenue. But it\'s also not a healthy or sustainable situation.</p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p>Some of the things Eric wants to see happen, like a standard interface for plugins and a curated view of the plugin ecosystem, are similar to views commonly expressed by designers, developers, and people in other professional roles at WordPress agencies serving enterprise clients. And why not? In the WordPress enterprise space, are the end users really that much different than mass-market WordPress users in what they do and <em>don\'t </em>need to quickly perform routine content creation and management tasks?&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>That\'s where my thinking has been lately, so I had a conversation with Eric to see if we might identify areas where nearly everyone thinks WordPress offers a poor experience and how we might align ourselves toward solutions. Can we get everyone to &#8220;yes&#8221; on a better UX?</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Don\'t Play Favorites — Recognize Excellence</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Standardizing admin interfaces and notifications might be easier than figuring out how to curate best-of-breed themes and plugins. But imagine, as Eric and I do in this conversation, some kind of &#8220;plugin quality score&#8221; at wordpress.org based on neutral, objective data. It might be &#8220;gamed&#8221; — in a positive way. It would encourage developers to do better, deeper, ever-maturing work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Personally, I\'d like to see the maximum and the average number of queries a plugin adds to a page. That, along with PHP and WordPress versions that have been tested for compatibility (which are existing features of the plugin repository) would be key code quality indicators. Frequency of updates, reviews, and support responses would indicate a capacity for long-term sustainability.  Raising <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-standards/\">standards for testing aimed mainly at performance and security</a> would be great too. All of this could be done or encouraged by key players in the WordPress ecosystem coming together to set standards for their industry. It would impact how all users of the plugin directory understand quality and how best to assemble a WordPress site.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Too Many Open Secrets About Quality are Bad for Everyone</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>As of today, there are 60,153 uncurated free plugins at wordpress.org that can only be explored via external search and a limited (<a href=\"https://poststatus.com/a-visit-from-the-good-idea-fairy/\">arguably broken</a>) site search tool. WordPress professionals with high-end client services would never expose their customers to this chaos — so why does the WordPress community expose its newcomers to it? Anyone who has developed WordPress sites for very long has a list of plugins they prefer, particularly in combination with each other, for common feature sets and use cases. We all have lists of plugins we disrecommend — to the point that it\'s a dealbreaker if a client insists on using them. And of course, these lists change a lot over time. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>We all know these things — but it\'s a kind of &#8220;open secret&#8221; within professional WordPress circles. That\'s understandable! Comparison is the thief of joy — and possibly revenue. But it\'s also not a healthy or sustainable situation. We need to be more open and better at communicating these things in a problem-solving, always-learning way within appropriate channels. <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/open-secrets-forced-updates-in-wordpress/\">Security is a slightly different issue</a>, but <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/WordPress-Coding-Standards\">performance and code quality standards</a> — and the products/people who follow them in exemplary ways — should be much more visible, celebrated, and learned from. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Information that maturing developers and product owners can learn from to improve their work doesn\'t trickle down as openly or as easily as it should. It\'s inside baseball, and it shouldn\'t be quite so insider-y. It\'s not out there alongside independent <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/kevin-ohashi-deep-history-and-integrity-in-hosting-benchmarks/\">plugin performance reviews</a> or clear standards and guidance for anyone who wants them. What if someone did a tutorial series walking through current WordPress code standards and the <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-coding-standards-has-reached-a/\">history</a> of <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/accessibility-draft-standards-are-ready-for-review/\">their</a> <a href=\"https://poststatus.com/wordpress-coding-standards-1-2-1-has-been/\">evolution</a>? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What if?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why not? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What are the barriers?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who can remove them?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Industry peers and WordPress community members working together on common interests?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>As Eric and I end up saying in our conversation, <em>we hope so!</em></p>\n\n\n\n<div class=\"is-layout-flex wp-container-44 wp-block-columns has-theme-palette-8-background-color has-background\" id=\"GoDaddy-Pro\">\n<div class=\"is-layout-flow wp-block-column\">\n<h3 id=\"GoDaddy-Pro\"><img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f64f.png\" alt=\"🙏\" class=\"wp-smiley\" /> Sponsor: <a href=\"https://poststat.us/godaddypro\">GoDaddy Pro</a></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Manage your clients, websites, and tasks from a single dashboard with <strong>GoDaddy Pro</strong>.

For one, you know, we have full site editing that\'s been around for a little bit now, and, you know, we\'re not seeing like huge adoption rates with it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re getting people to, um, you know, kind of learn what\'s involved with that and block themes and, um, [00:02:00] and also at the same time we\'re, you know, the, the changes that we\'ve seen, The block editor over time and you know, even the, kind of, the genesis of that project I think was to kind of compete with, um, more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Content management systems, kind of like, you know, WS or Squarespace and what have you. Um, and it seems like WordPress is just going toward that market more and more as they, as they build on. And so I thought those were really nice steps in that direction, right? So we have tools that. Make it a little bit easier for someone who maybe isn\'t, uh, familiar with code to go in and and build a, a site.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But that led me to think about, well, what else should we be doing in that area? What else could WordPress do to make it. Uh, as foolproof as possible, um, to build a basic site, not something necessarily like, um, you know, a complex, you know, high end enterprise site, [00:03:00] but just something basic that someone can do within a couple of hours.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that really kind of where that, the post came from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. Have you seen the, uh, videos where Jamie Marsland and, uh, who else did this had, had their daughters or, Um, I think of very different ages too, but it tried to do exactly that. And, um, he had, he had his kids do, um, um, Elementor versus Gutenberg, I think it was.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. Yeah. And that was, that was interesting. I mean, you really have to. That totally someone totally different from you, um, using it for the first time and Yeah, I think, I think a lot of, um, thought has gone into that user experience is, is huge. Uh, now, of course, always, always should have been, but um, Gutenberg is, is very squarely focused on the, on the user experience, building out your, your site and, and [00:04:00] pages.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, my, my thought though was everyone wants that. Um, it\'s not just the mass market, the lower and middle end, um, of that, but, um, agencies to up. The, uh, those that are serving enterprise, enterprise clients, uh, WordPress, v i p partners, um, I hear, I hear the same things from them, like, you know, even very recent conversations, um, about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How having standard interface that doesn\'t throw you different, totally different screens when you use, uh, a plugin in the back end. Um, that\'s a, a con basic design principle of there\'s much less cognitive load on you when the navigation is standard. Even if you\'ve never used WordPress before, um, [00:05:00] you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re f it seems familiar because things are intuitively laid out. Cause it\'s, it\'s like a lot of other things. WordPress is, is old enough and in so influential that it\'s, it\'s, uh, backend interface has been copied in a lot of ways. It\'s very, very familiar. Um, interestingly, even if people haven\'t used it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so when you hit a plugin with, you know, crazy level of setting screens or its own interface design, um, that\'s not, that doesn\'t. Look good with, uh, with anyone really, but with a enterprise client. I, I think that\'s an issue. That\'s one of the things you talk about in here. Um, Yeah, we have you thought about that at all?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, how, Yeah. Pretty much every market, every WordPress market, uh, could benefit from.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> It\'s, it\'s funny you mentioned that cuz I really wasn\'t thinking of like the enterprise clients. And I [00:06:00] think the reason for that is because usually if I have a client who\'s a little more higher end on the, on the price scale, I\'m usually building things to kind of account for all of that right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Where I can, I mean, obviously I can\'t change a in ui, but I can certainly do things with custom fields or blocks or what have you to try and make the, the content creation and editing process. Simple as possible for them. So by, by doing some of these things at core level, you would take away the need to build all that extra stuff on top to, you know, to make it easier for the corporate client to use.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So I think it, it, it goes together pretty well. Um, The one example in terms of UI that I have in the article is, uh, you know, just looking at the standard WordPress settings page. We have the reading settings, and then next to it I have, uh, the opening screen of slider Revolution, which is, uh, plugin bundled with [00:07:00] a bunch of different schemes and, uh, like a theme forest, what have you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it\'s like a completely different thing. And to, to that end, even Elementor is as well, I mean the, a lot of. Popular page builder plugins basically take over, uh, the UI and it\'s like you\'re in a completely different planet. And think about if you\'re a brand new user and you\'ve got just Elementor or Slider Revolution on your site, you bought this theme and it comes with these things, you\'re kind of thinking you\'re dropped into a middle of Mars or something.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You\'re not sure what, you know how to get back to where you were and what the difference is between. You know, that UI based versus, you know, the, the core WordPress ui. Uh, in a lot of ways that doesn\'t make sense. So I think that\'s something we have to try and unify. Um, I don\'t know how we go about doing that at the core level.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, but I, I think if we make core as clean as possible, maybe that\'s at [00:08:00] least a good start.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah, there were, there would have to be, um, some, some standards in reusable. Patterns and, and tools. Um, I, I think that in the long run, the, uh, Gutenberg is, is supposed to eat the entire, you know, it\'s, it\'s a true ship of Tesus project where the entire thing gets rebuilt while moving.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, And in, in some way it will be a, the goal is, is to have a unified experience at the end of that, just how quickly that happens depends on, on core contribution. Um, on the velocity of that, um, Yeah, that\'s for lack of that. I, I think it\'s, um, it\'s a bad experience for everyone and Sure. Uh, uh, an enterprise client is really just at bottom end users, uh, employees who have as much experience maybe as the average DIY site builder, a [00:09:00] creator, someone who wants to start a podcast or, or sell a product, um, as a side project or something like that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There\'s, there\'s really no difference there. Everyone, um, has the same, uh, usability needs in general, and more or less, there\'s, there\'s big differences when you, you started talking about compliance needs with accessibility and, and so on and, and things like that. But, um, yeah, it seems like to me that there, there\'s a lot of opportunity for aligning, um, different parts of, of the word.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Community and business community where. Plug in. Developers and owners should really want this. The same thing that, uh, agency people, um, do. And that\'s, they, they support each other. Um, they feed each other business. So I, I\'m curious why. That hasn\'t [00:10:00] happened, and it seems to me like there\'s some information flows or I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>There there are probably other, other sticky barriers. Have you, did you, did that question come up for you at all? Why? Um, why?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Well, I know it\'s like, it\'s something we\'ve talked about a little bit, right? I mean, yeah, just on, on a few different levels and with the, uh, you know, Active install data going away from wordpress.org, and maybe these folks need to band together a little more and, and share amongst each other.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I, I think the reason it hasn\'t happened yet is because it really hasn\'t had to, um, you know, maybe they haven\'t seen necessarily the benefit of it, but when you see kind of the, the yeah. Jumble of the, the UI right now and how it, how different it can be depending on what you have installed. You know, maybe there is something that, you know, some of these larger plugin developers could work together on.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sure. Uh, it makes sense. You know, it makes sense for all of them. I mean, [00:11:00] I, I, I somehow see us heading towards some sort of consortium of, of, uh, folks who, who can\'t necessarily write strict standards, but maybe they have certain. You know, broad outlines of, of what they, they want to, to abide by. And, you know, the more people that do that, the better I think it is for WordPress users and for just really everyone involved, because the software\'s going to be easier to use and more uniform.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. There\'s, there\'s a lot that the, um, that, that part of the community could do for itself. I\'ve, uh, Tried to be more vocal about, but I, I think there, there have been a few, few voices behind those ideas of you, Hey, you, there\'s a lot you can do, um, to shape your own industry. Um, Yeah, if you do have a shared, a shared interface framework and, um, formal or informal standards for [00:12:00] Yeah, we were talking about.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Admin notifications previously. Um, that\'s part of it. Um, it, it\'d save you a lot of time if there was a base to build on. Um, more than, more than I think exists now. Um, so that, uh, anyone starting, starting out creating a, a new plugin, um, would have some kind of, uh, head start. Really a standard interface or, or guidance at least.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I don\'t know that there\'s that much, um, public information. And, uh, it\'s curious to me as, as, uh, as things like the W Commerce, um, partnership program kind of is a bit, looks like, a bit like a, getting into, uh, a relationship with WordPress, v i p. Um, there\'s criteria to go through, uh, that you have, well you have to meet, um, to become, um, a preferred agency working.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, with w commerce.com side with [00:13:00] automatic, um, what those criteria are and what the standards are, should I think, have some kind of trickle down effect, like know what they are and, um, and have them as at least aspirational for everyone. Um, there\'s been some talk in, in, uh, core of, um, bringing. Some changes on, uh, on standards and testing for, uh, coding, um, coding standards for security.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, I think primarily performance and security. Um, and I hope those continue to get prioritized that that\'s what all seems, seems to need to happen to, um, to move this forward. But the one point you mentioned, um, where you\'re talking about modernizing the onboarding experience, Where you direct people to, where to find themes, where to find plugins that, uh, [00:14:00] that becomes challenging and touches, touches.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>This other recent issue we\'ve talked about, um, it is hard to search in the, in the plugin repository is not in an ideal state and people who are trying to sell. Their plugins there, um, have a number of frustrations with, with trying to surface their, their products as relevant to what people are searching for.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, do you think this could be part of a solution to that if, or a potential conflict point when you\'re curating, you\'re, you\'re curating and recommending, um, certain ones?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Well, I think as far as, as core goes, um, my idea is more. Just pointing people to the repositories. Mm-hmm. , uh, for themes and plugins, not necessarily being a, uh, a [00:15:00] curator, but, um, I, I, I see the, you know, I see there, there, there should be more impetus to improve the, the repositories and make them easier for folks to search and figure out what it is they\'re getting and what, you know, um, allow new entries to be a little more, uh, visible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But I think they\'re kind of separate things, you know, just to be able to, I mean, if, if you\'re installing WordPress now from the, you know, from, from your host, or if you\'re, you know, FTPing it up to your site, old school style, um, you know, you\'re, you\'re gonna get this little. Widget did on the, on the front screen of the dashboard that welcomes you to WordPress and gives you a few handy links, but it doesn\'t really tell you about how to actually use what you\'re, you\'ve got.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think that was where I, I thought improvement could be made right now. I mean the person that doesn\'t understand where themes reside or where plug-ins reside, they\'re not [00:16:00] gonna know necessarily to go under the appearance menu and look to add a theme or you know, the plug-ins menu. You know, they may find that eventually, but why not put it right out there in front of \'em so that they can easily click and say, Okay, I know what I need.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I need to get a plugin that does this. And you know, cuz we have a nice interface to actually go in and. Poor plugins and themes, but Right. It\'s not necessarily, um, in front of, front of your mind when you, when you first install WordPress. So I thought that was, um, something that was important to, uh, you know, to, to emphasize in this.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. Yeah. And that, that seems like it, it\'s potentially in a good way, open for change with, uh, potential changes to the.org repository. And, and I imagine that as, um, as the.com marketplace. Um, and, you know, potentially other, other things like that. Um, If, if other hosts hosting W Commerce or, or [00:17:00] WordPress were to do something similar, um, that, that, that requires some kind of curation at some point or some, some way of featuring particular things like, this is what you need to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, for, for example, you know, one of my pet things is can you build a, uh, sub stack like, uh, site out of WordPress very quickly. Yes, if you know how. But, um, the, there\'s act, those documentations kind of emerged relatively recently for doing that with a, a couple of plugins. Um, if you dig around on wordpress.com, um, and I, like Kim Coleman is, uh, for, uh, uh, paid memberships.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Pro is giving a talk right about now, I think on. On how to do that with, uh, Mail poet and their product, the Coleman\'s product, uh, paid membership pro. Um, that\'s, that\'s something that, um, yeah, [00:18:00] I, I agree. It\'s, it\'s tri on the, on the mass market level. It\'s, it\'s sort of the level of suggestion of here\'s if you want to do this, here are some ways you can do that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And. What gets recommended there, I, I guess, is, is maybe a, a thorny issue, but as you kind of move up the up the market, um, you don\'t want give that much. You don\'t want to have an onboarding screen that says install this and this and this to, uh, you know, an agency\'s client. Uh, you know, you don\'t, they don\'t wanna see that either.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So, um, you want to actually be making those choices. For them. So it occurs to me that the thing that\'s not talked about OP openly but is talked about everywhere is that the upmarket WordPress and building even, you know, freelancers, small agencies to v i P agencies generally, um, you know, have their own ways of doing things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:19:00] That do a lot of curation and like you said, building, building custom materials. But the less you do that, the less you have to support yourself. Um, that they\'re essentially doing, making these choices and saying, these are the things that work well for these purposes under these conditions. And I\'ve always thought, why should that be a proprietary trade secret, especially when it\'s out there, but.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We\'re hesitant to, uh, convey that or some version of that to the, um, to the mass market. Um, what, what do you, what do you think about that? Do you think there could be some synergies there? Cause there\'s learning potential too, if you, if you kind of disclose, this is how we\'re doing it up here. Um, people who are just starting out building with WordPress are learning from leaders then.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah. Um, well, one of the things I. I, I talked about with curation was, you know, maybe managed hosts are in the best [00:20:00] position to do kind of something like that, because I think some of them already do to, to a degree. I mean, many of them are buying up, you know, plugin and themes anyway. And so, you know, maybe they\'re in the best position to add something like this, The WordPress, um, for someone that has the fresh install, You know, in the community it\'s, it\'s interesting because there\'s just so many, there\'s so many plugins and so many opinions that you know mm-hmm.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>I may ask, well how do you build a membership site? And somebody may tell me, paid memberships, pros the way to go. Somebody may say, Member press, or, you know, there there could be five or six other, you know, really big players in that market. Um, same thing for forms and, you know, e-commerce may be a little bit less, but, um, you know, cuz we have one dominant, uh, you.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Entity there in W Commerce. But, um, you know, if you ask about w commerce extensions, you\'ll probably get a couple hundred different answers on that, so. Right. You know, the curation is a, a [00:21:00] bit of a tough, a tough call. Like, I, I don\'t, I certainly don\'t think, you know, the WordPress project should be, um, doing anything other than generically taking you to the, you know, Repositories and saying, this is where you can find plugins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Now, maybe in the future they write, you know, they, they share articles or something about, well, you know, if you\'re going to build an e-commerce site, maybe you should consider X, Y, and Z. Not necessarily talking about. Specific plugins, but things you need to consider on your end and find to help you find the, the tool that works best for your needs and, you know, design for what your workflow is going to be.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so maybe if we can add some guidance in that way without necessarily favoring one product over another. Um, but I, I, I think they\'re, you know, for the new user, the person who wants to just build their own basic site, Having some sort of guidance in [00:22:00] not only what plugins to use, but just how to use WordPress, I think could be, you know, extremely helpful.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yes. Uh, yeah, I, I agree with you. Um, you know, the way you, you put it here was, um, Uh, yeah, the, who would be responsible for curating is the, is the really tough issue. You\'d need a, a third party of some, some kind to take that on. Um, and yeah, in the mass market where everyone\'s competing, um, with, with their product or service, um, that\'s a difficult one to do.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Who, who would be a third party? Who could, who could potentially navigate those, those waters? And are, are there things that the plugin repo could do that are sufficiently neutral with the kind of data that, that could be reported out that would, um, help that? Um, do we need something like Kevin Ohashi doing, um, you know, [00:23:00] plugin performance?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>WP plugin performance reviews, like his hosting, uh, reviews.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah, that, that\'s interesting. You could, you, you could certainly see the repo. I mean, you know, again, you don\'t wanna play favorites. That\'s definitely, you know, gonna cause a lot of problems. Um, maybe there could be, you know, stats for, you know, different types of sites.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, if you are into publishing, these are the most popular plugins in that category. Because we don\'t, It may even be listed that way now, but we don\'t necessarily say that. Um, so you could look at, you know, membership sites, you could look at e-commerce, um, you know, selling digital goods, all those types of things.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Maybe we break it down by category a little more and just show what the trends are in that area. It doesn\'t necessarily have to favor anyone, but obviously it\'s going to show, you know, who\'s in the lead and who\'s not. Maybe that\'s [00:24:00] something to help people again and again, I, I put these out there as ideas.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>They may be extremely flawed and, uh, you know, you can certainly tell me on Twitter if, if, if you don\'t agree. Uh, but just I think we need to find more ways to empower people to make good decisions with WordPress. Um, that\'s going to keep people on the platform. Throughout and they\'re going to hopefully have less frustration in trying to get started because I think that\'s, from my experience, that\'s the area where people are, you know, hit that wall after installing, They\'re like, Okay, well what do I do next?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. Yeah. I wonder, I wonder if something like a, uh, plugin quality score could be developed. Which, which to some extent is being done with, with, uh, review, like combining, uh, correlating, um, support tickets and response to those and, [00:25:00] um, installs and, and things like that. But I wonder if you could, you could do a quality, um, rating that would be sufficiently neutral that people would accept.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The curation that developed from that. Say, I, I keep thinking of this one. I don\'t, I don\'t know if it\'s realistic, but, um, I would love to know on every plugin if I install this, what\'s the, what\'s the maximum number of queries it will add to a page load? What\'s the average number? And, um, that right there creates an incentive to plug in developers to get that right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Learn, you know, if you\'re just starting out, uh, coding something, um, learn what that means, why it matters. Um, because that\'s, that seems to be one of the real, real slow downs. Um, and, and that\'s a pretty objective measure. Fewer queries, quicker response, um, from the server, [00:26:00] something like that. I don\'t know.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Do you, do you think that that sort of thing could potentially be done, um, as. Sufficiently neutral thing coming from the, From</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I think so. I think so. I mean, one idea that just kind of popped in my head was, how about we do something activity based? Hmm. Like, just for example, um, we take into account how often a plugin updates, uh, how responsive, uh, Right.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, support requests are in the forms. That doesn\'t necessarily tell you the quality. Now I. You might be updating your plugin three or four times a week because it\'s broken, and you may be re responding to, you know, support requests without necessarily resolving problems. But that might be a way to, to, to help steer people away from plugins that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Haven\'t been updated in years. I mean, we have that little warning on there now that, you know, when it\'s been, I think, what three versions. It\'ll tell [00:27:00] you that, hey, this hasn\'t been, you know, updated in, in a while, huh? But if you had maybe some sort of activity based scoring that, you know, I mean, you know, that, that puts everybody, I think on a.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Closer playing field. I don\'t know if it\'s completely level, but you know, I mean, the plugins with the most resources might, you know, be able to, to, uh, to win on some of that. But then again, if you have a, a solo entrepreneur who\'s got a plugin that you know, they really are passionate about and they\'re constantly trying to improve and they\'re, you know, we know there are a lot of those out there, you know, they might be able to, to compete on that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Sure. Yeah. I, I feel, I feel like that could work if the repository made some distinction between completely free plugins and freemium model plugins, or those that have, uh, a recognized business entity behind it with. Staff and [00:28:00] like this, We exist here to support this in theory, in in perpetuity. Um, because actually there, there are some plugin if you base this on activity like TenUp.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, there\'s some, Jake Goldman still has under, under his account on, uh, on the repo that are really nice, simple, single purpose plugins and I completely trust. The support for them, for them, for the, for the most part. But, um, they\'re not, they\'re not gonna be high volume, um, uh, support activity there or updates, and they\'re pretty simple, yet reliable.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, it might be tricky to do that, but I, I think it would be fair to recognize. Leaders and high performers and recognized experts at, at some point. And, um, and the business, um, you know, the number of people who, you know, who actually exist to support [00:29:00] a particular plugin. That was when I was, when I\'m doing things for clients and when I was doing that a lot more, um, you\'re looking at, I, I try to look at what\'s gonna be around for a long, long term.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, the, the fewer, uh, We don\'t wanna make changes to themes, to major plugin changes. Um, over time we want this to be really stable. So, so to me a concern would be, Hey, this is a really nice plugin, seems really well supported, but there\'s no business model behind it. Or it\'s not one that, yeah, I think will be here in five, even just five years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, and the long term view. Yeah. Is another, is another criteria that\'s hard to, hard to suss out. Um, but those are, those are all potentially valid ways to curate, um, and indicate different, different categories of, of product that may really help people figure out what they need. Um, yeah, it\'s a [00:30:00] good, good question, uh, to open.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> Yeah, I think there\'s, there\'s potential for it. Um, you know, any, I think anything we can do to make it, give people more confidence that what they\'re installing is going to work and be, you know, stable and, you know, allow them to do. What they want to do easy in a more easy fashion. I think that would, you know, definitely be a benefit.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And just going back to the activity thing for just a second, I mean, how many plugins that are still, you know, somewhat maintained, Still say that their, their latest compatibility is like WordPress 5.8 or 5.9. Right. You know, just the simple fact of going in and, and testing with WordPress six or 6.1, maybe that gets you, you know, some brownie points in that as well.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Just that you version checked and you know, you\'re keeping up with that. Because I see that as another issue [00:31:00] in the repository where, There may be plugins that work perfectly well, but you\'re still a little hesitant because it, Yeah. You know, the compatibility hasn\'t been updated in two years or three years.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So that could also be, you know, a</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> factor. And it\'s not just compatibility to WordPress, it\'s, uh, you know, word WordPress, GUIs and, and compatibility for php. So plug in, plug in compatibility with, uh, which, what up to what version of PHP will it. Will it operate</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> and Yeah. Just checking. Yeah, I know. Uh, like I\'m looking at a, a plugin now it says PHP version 5.4 or higher.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>So there you go. Ah, right, right, right. You\'re in good shape, even out in a really, really old install.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yes. Right. So that raises some, some ideas. Well, that\'s, and that\'s something a DIY person isn\'t gonna know. They aren\'t, they aren\'t going to know. Um, you know, what version of PHP is my. Running and what does that mean and, and all that.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>[00:32:00] Yeah. Support activity and development activity are, are good indicators, but then you, you can game that as well. Um, well, it creates, it creates a good incentive to do that work. But then, you know, are we adding features or minor updates just to, uh, to rank higher at that point. I don\'t know if it would have that, that kind of effect.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I mean, we\'ve seen it with reviews, right? Yeah. People put in the phony reviews and or higher out firms to, to do that for them. So yeah, any, anything that they put in probably could be gained. I don\'t know if we\'re gonna fully prevent that, but you hope that, you know, most developers take it as a, uh, a serious matter and, you know, try to actually put in the hard work to, to rank highly and, and.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Hopefully that that\'s a way for them to kind of go up the charts a little bit in, in terms of how many installs they have and how many paying customers they get because of it. Right. [00:33:00]</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> Yeah. And there\'s, there\'s such a categorical difference between people who are running their business that way. And well, it\'s a good, it\'s a good way to game things towards more support, more development, and, uh, taking an active interest in, in what\'s going on with your, your product.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And in the way it\'s, uh, presented to people who are going to install it. Um, and it\'s. Good idea. I, I do feel that those things go together. Any, anything that improves or changes in, in core to change the onboarding experience to, um, make it easier with respect to what you install, has gotta be corresponding somehow to, um, what you see on the on.org, um, what it\'s putting out publicly as a, as a signal for, um, for quality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The last thing. Well close to where you, you closed was, was talking about outreach, um, that we should just show what, what WordPress can do. [00:34:00] Um, and do you think we just don\'t do that enough or it\'s not unified enough? Or just in the Gutenberg era, we\'re just beginning to see tutorials and guides, um, show up, especially for non-technical users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And, um, that\'s, that\'s something. on.org, Learn, Learn. Um, wordpress.org is, uh, busy trying to do, there\'s a ton of meetups coming out that are really geared towards this sort of thing. Um, and, and also people who are building at sites at a more advanced level. Um, do you see that as something that\'s just starting to happen or something altogether different that you had in mind?</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> I, I sort of see this as kind of like a, a. Coming of WordPress, right? Because when a lot of us, you know, who have been in this a while started, you know, if you went to a Word camp, you probably learned an awful lot about the basics of WordPress. Whether you were just [00:35:00] using it as, you know, a content creator, or you were a developer.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And I think we\'ve kind of lost that along the way a little bit. We\'ve kind of focused so much on the more advanced topics. And then of course, the pandemic, you know, took away a, a lot of the in person events. So I, I think, you know, the word camps are one way to really start showing, you know, new users what\'s possible and you know, how to, to do the basics.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, you know, I, I would, I honestly, I would love to see that at Word Camp us or one of the really. International events, you know, have a track just for new people, uh, you know, where they can ask experts questions, you know, that people that, you know, we, we see in the post status slack or we see on online all the time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You know, if, if a new user\'s able to ask them questions that, you know, that can go a long way towards selling them on the platform and keeping them there. Um, and you mentioned the learn [00:36:00] tool. Well, I, I think that\'s fantastic. That\'s actually something I brought up on the, uh, on the slack the other day. You know, Has there been any effort to kind of integrate that with the core software so that you can easily find tutorials?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Uh, maybe through a plugin or, or something like that? Because we have various WordPress support, uh, tools that are third party, you know, that\'ll show videos on how to do different things. We have this wonderful resource and if somebody doesn\'t visit wordpress.org, they\'re really not gonna know it\'s. And I think, you know, it\'s such an opportunity to reach people and, and teach them how to do anything from the basics to, you know, once they level up to, you know, some more advanced things, it\'s all right there waiting and, you know, all we have to do in some way, some respects is, you know, put it in front of them, You know, give them the opportunity to see it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, so those are things, you know. The WordPress community has so much great content, so many smart people. I think we [00:37:00] ought to be able to put our heads together and, and find ways to, you know, encourage new users and embrace them and, and, and, you know, kind of help them, you know, with any stumbling blocks.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>And because, you know, if once we kind of. Hate to say the phrase die out. You know, what, what, what is the next generation of WordPress user going to look like? How, how are they going to use the software? You know, if we want to keep it as a market leader, we want to keep it, uh, viable, you know, the new users are, you know, just critical</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> to that, right?</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Yeah. I, I think that Learn is, uh, learn. WordPress is. Logical, the content that\'s being developed there and also the meetups that are going on, the, um, kind of webinars that are, that are happening are, um, are logical to move into the dashboard for certain, um, certain use [00:38:00] cases, um, in the, in mass market, DIY users.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>All right, well, It\'s been good talking to you again. I, I think this, this is a good, a good topic with a lot of questions in it that touch a couple of the main, main conversations and, and issues today that we\'ve, we\'ve been all, all thinking about, um, what to do with, uh, potential changes to the plugin repository and, and the kind of data that that comes out of there.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Dot org content and information can somehow fit into the, um, into the WordPress dashboard and, um, interface there to help people and connect them with the community. Um, how we could maybe standardize, uh, the experience and some interface design, how things are, are done on the back end that, um, makes [00:39:00] it a more palatable and, uh, Less busy interruptive, um, or confused experience on, on sites with a lot of things installed, whether it\'s, um, someone just setting up their own, their own site, or, uh, an agency doing it for a, a high end client.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Um, I think the more, the more we see those all as, uh, common problems everyone has. The better chance at br at bringing everyone towards a, an aligned solution where everyone wins. Um, ideally one, one would hope .</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Eric Karcovack:</strong> There\'s potential there. Absolutely. Hope so. Um, you know, The, the, you know, if you start the conversation, hopefully, um, you know, you bring in some good ideas and if we see a few of them implemented, uh, that\'s like you said, that\'s gonna benefit everybody.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Dan Knauss:</strong> You have been listening to post status excerpt, a podcast from post Status, the [00:40:00] community for WordPress professionals.

It hides all non-essential UI and clears the canvas for a focus on text-based content creation. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>The mode can be toggled on in the options menu in the top toolbar.

This distraction-free mode is a monumental improvement over the days when users struggled to write with various UI elements popping in and out of view.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Another major update in 14.4 is the <a href=\"https://github.com/WordPress/gutenberg/pull/44028\">redesigned pattern inserter</a>. It has been updated to show the categories before rendering the patterns, giving users a more fluid visual preview as they browse the pattern library.
