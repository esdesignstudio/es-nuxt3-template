= Since I have no PHP knowledge at all, is this plugin for me? =

Absolutely, you can! 
Unlike many other plugins, you don't have to do any code changes to make your post order to apply, accordingly to custom-defined order. There is an option to auto-update the WordPress queries so the posts will be returned in customised order. This can be turned off (Autosort) to allow customized code usage.

= I prefer to apply the sort through code, how can be done? =

Include a 'orderby' => 'term_order' within your get_terms() arguments.

= What taxonomies will allow me to sort? =

You can sort ALL taxonomies ( hierarhically active ), including the default Categories.

= Is there any way i can get my admin interface to use the custom terms order? =

Absolutely, the plugin can do that. In fact you can configure so only the admin will update and the front side template will display the terms as before.

= There is a feature that i want it implemented, can you do something about it? =

All ideas are welcome and i put them on my list to be implemented into the new versions. Anyway this may take time, but if you are in a rush, please consider a small donation and we can arrange something.

= I still need more features =

Consider upgrading to our advanced version of this plugin at a very resonable price <a target="_blank" href="http://www.nsp-code.com/premium-plugins/wordpress-plugins/advanced-taxonomy-terms-order/">Advanced Taxonomy Terms Order Order</a>
